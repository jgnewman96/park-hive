## Current Projects

### Repeated Generator

I am currently working on a project centered on writing and generating new ideas. Check out [repeated generator](https://repeatedgenerator.netlify.app/) for more details.

### Future of Organizations

I have been doing some thinking about how funding impacts work and what new types of organizations could look like. Here is the series of posts I have written on the topic.
* [Incentives and Funding Models](#/post/diversity_in_funding_models)
* [The Current Funding Situation](#/post/a_different_funding_model)
* [Substack Limitatons and DAO Possibilities](#/post/substack_limitations_and_dao_possibilities)

## Previous Projects


### Applied ML Reading Group

One of the most compelling parts of doing academic research is the community that you get to be apart of. It is exciting to talk about research with colleagues and hear their opinions. Their thoughts push you to expand your own thinking and look at problems from different perspectives. Trying to create our own community, my friend [Tushar](https://tusharc.dev/) and I created an applied ML reading group. We read one research paper a week and then discussed it every friday. 

The questions we were most interested in were how do we integrate technology with society. How do we understand the impacts that technology is having on individuals. Technology in general, but Machine Learning and AI specifically are radically changing what our world looks like. There is both the positive and the negative of these changes. By focusing on designing tools that brings about the world we want, we should be able to tilt the scales towards positive outcomes. That will require lots of careful research and deep understanding.

We believe more work needs to be done that bridges the gap between pure academic research and industry. There is so much knowledge that gets created in academia that does not get brought out to the rest of the world. The creation of the knowledge is not enough, it has to be disseminated and made accessible. Their should be more outputs by which research is measured then just academic papers. Writing blog posts, building a tool or creating community can often be just as impactful as a paper. I love building intuitive software that is accessible to others.

After reading each paper both of us summarized the paper and added some of our own thoughts. You can read [Tushar's notes here](https://tusharc.dev/categories/papers.html) and mine [here](/#/medium/paper). We selected papers to read in the following way.
- One of us sends five paper options to the other person
- The other person then picks from those five options.


#### Human Computer Interaction + Machine Learning

While machine learning is a very powerful tool, it is currently inaccessible to most people. Current algorithms  learn through methods very different than how humans natively learn. To teach a human how to recognize a cat you might explain what a cat is and show the human a couple of photos. To teach the machine you provide it with thousands of photos and tell it whether or not the photo has a cat in it. While the human is able to understand the core qualities of a cat from a few examples, it takes the machine thousands of examples and labels to understand what actually constitutes a cat.

During my undergraduate studies, I had the pleasure of conducting researching supervised by professor [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/). We explored whether humans could teach machines through a more complex and native interaction than just providing labels. Is there potential for humans to teach computers, through explanations for example? We studied this by conducting a human research study where we asked participants to provide labels and explanations for an image classification task. We characterized the different types of information participants provided and how it could be used to train an image classification system. We also did a follow up experiment demonstrating how the explanations could be used to jump start the training process.

I was first author on our paper that was presented at INTERACT 2019 in Paphos, Cyprus. Here is a link to the paper and my slides from the presentation
