For the past half year I have not been posting here as frequently. I have not been reading papers, typing out full book notes or doing as much reflection writing. The main catalyst for this change was a job transition that I made. At the beginning of February I started working as a Data Scientist at [Whisper.Ai](https://whisper.ai/) after leaving [Change Research](https://changeresearch.com/). 

This project / website always provided a nice place for my intellectual energy to go. When I was frustrated about work or felt like I was not getting enough out of it, working on this project provided a nice outlet. For my first half year at Whisper, I have not felt as much of a pull to work on this project. 

I have wanted to write something about why I left Change and how I approached my job search for a while. It also feels important to reflect on why I have been working on this project less and what my time at Whisper has been like so far.

## Why I wanted to leave Change

One valuable way I have learned a lot is by reading articles / pieces from other people who work in tech. I have learned about project management, coding best practices, communication and what a successful company looks like. Reading pieces written by people at other tech companies,  made it clear that some tech companies have really figured out an organization and structure that helps them be successful. Neither Nielsen or Change Research (CR) felt like that. People at both companies did not spend a lot of time thinking about how they worked. 

At CR in particular I was spending a lot of my time trying to improve the way that we worked. I was working to implement better communication and project planning. I really enjoyed doing that work and was doing it because it felt like the most impactful thing I could be doing. Improving planning or communication can have a much larger impact than just writing code. But at CR it did not feel like anyone cared that I was trying to do that work or felt it was important. That obstacle was really disheartening. 

At CR it did not feel like I was having a meaningful impact to bring about the world that I want. One of the main reasons I joined CR was because I was excited about the potential impact I could have there. I was excited about helping liberal candidates win elections and enact change. But the longer I was at CR the more clear it was that I was helping support a harmful system. A system predicated on beating a foe, rather than helping people in need. A system that did not see individuals but rather broad generalizations of people. That type of system felt actively toxic to me and not one that I wanted to be in. 

People are CR were not interested in questioning what their impact was. They accepted the assumption that polling was good and polling for all democrats was good. But it never become apparent to me that polling was actually a good thing. Did running polls help candidates win elections? As an engineer / data scientist it was pretty apparent to me that a poll was a terrible product. The data that was collected from the poll was quite valuable, but then the way it is turned into a final product stripped it of almost all its value. Rather than building machine learning models to help target voters, we created a lossy summary called cross tabs which then had to be manually interpreted by an individual who might give the campaign some useful information. 

When CR was founded, the goal was to disrupt the polling industry. And maybe doing online polling at the time was really a disruption. But in 2020, the way to really make advances in the field would not be to improve upon polling. It would be to use that some data in different ways. I could write a full piece on all the things wrong with the polling industry (why do people focus so much on random sampling and nobody talks about how turnout uncertainty is one of the biggest impacts on poll accuracy) but it was disheartening to work on what felt like a bad product. CR was working on delivering a bad product cheaper rather than creating an actual good product

When I joined CR I was committed to being there until after the 2020 election. After the 2020 election I was going to evaluate if it was somewhere I wanted to stay long term. Post the 2020 election it did not feel like CR had a plan for what the company should work on or how it would grow. That also meant it was unclear to me how I would continue to grow at CR. 

All of these things made it feel like it was the right decision to start looking elsewhere for a new job.

## Search Criteria

At the beginning, I was unsure what I wanted out of my next opportunity. When I was moving to CR I knew I wanted to work at a start up. When I was leaving CR there was part of me that thought I might want to work at a big tech company. After talking with a former colleague of mine about his experience working at Google, it seemed like working at a big tech company would not be a great fit for me. At large organizations there is a lot of bureaucracy. Being happy is so dependent on the project you are on and a lot of the work is maintenance work rather than really exciting stuff. 

Early on in my career I want to emphasize having a diversity of experience. Being in many different situations and different roles helps me understand what is important and what impacts my happiness. Being at CR and Nielsen helped me understand so much what I want in a job but also what I do not want in job. Working in a new space also helps me continue to build the skill of ramping up and contributing to a project you do not have previous expertise.

I decided to be less focused on the product space of the company and to focus on the people at the company. The people that I am working with on a day to day basis have the largest impact on my happiness. There are so many different projects I could be working on that I would find immensely interesting. Focusing on people rather than product made the job search a little challenging. It meant that when I was looking at potential companies I had to dig deeper on the people who worked there. Companies do a lot of marketing about their product but not as much marketing about their people. This meant I cast a wider net and used interviews to get a better sense of the people at a company. 

I was also interested in not working on a traditional SAS product. There are many reasons why there are so many successful SAS companies. Software is a really good business model. I was curious to explore working at a company that is not a software company and understanding the challenges that entails.

## How I decided to join Whisper 
After my search I was deciding between offers from both [Dover](https://www.dover.com/) and Whisper. After taking sometime to consider both options, or even neither option, it felt like working at Whisper most aligned with what I was looking for. 

During the interview process there were a few people at Whisper who I was really impressed with and excited about working with. It felt like being at the same company as these people would present the best opportunity for me to learn and grow. 

I was really excited about the impact of building a better hearing aid. My father has severe hearing loss. I know how hard that is for him and how much a hearing aid helps. While his hearing aid helps him, there is still a long way to go. It is noticeable how much his everyday life has been impacted as his hearing capacity has diminished and how much harder it is to interact with others.  Providing a better experience to people with hearing loss is something that is hugely impactful. 

My role at Whisper was also going to be different from my previous roles. Most of my previous roles were some combination of a machine learning or data engineer. At Whisper I am the only data scientist and am actually in the product organization rather than the engineering organization. At first this was a source of some nervousness but I grew to be excited about the new opportunity this would entail. My role involves helping to change our culture around data and we use data in the organization. I have a lot of latitude to work on what I think is important and to help make important product decisions.

## Time at Whisper

My first half year at Whisper has been really enjoyable. I have been working quite hard, and it  feels like I have grown a lot while meaningfully helping the company. I have felt a lot less existential career angst and that is probably why I have been working on this website less. There are a few people at work who I have learned a lot from and who I really enjoy working with. With both my other jobs I knew at this point already that I probably wanted to leave but it does not feel that way at Whisper. 
   
A lot of my time has been focused on building the necessary data infrastructure. That means setting up data pipelines and our data warehouse. I have been also balancing that with getting shorter term wins using data as it becomes available. Since there was no data scientist before me, a lot of the companies habits and culture were built in a world where data was not available. Making changes to culture is difficult, so just creating infrastructure is not enough. This means there is not a set of tasks that I need to execute on, but rather I need to work with teams to tease how data can be helpful to them. 

I really believe in the company direction and leadership at Whisper. The leadership has shown the ability to adept and make smart decisions. I believe Whisper is going to be quite a successful company and I am excited to be part of that journey. Trusting the company leadership and direction reduces so much mental burden on a day to day basis. 

Even at Whisper I still have trouble connecting to the impact of my work. It is not always clear how my work improves someones hearing health and therefore there lives. But every now and then I get a glimpse. I see when analysis helps us improve the product and how that will have a real impact on users.
