## Why I am leaving Nielsen

Nielsen was my first experience working at a full time job and in a lot of ways it was a good one. I learned an immense amount and became a much better data scientist. I met a lot of very smart people who helped me grow and taught me a lot. There were a lot of frustrations though during my time at Nielsen and I thought it would be worthwhile to expand upon why I am leaving. All of these things together made Nielsen a difficult place to work at times. If I had not had such great managers I would have probably looked to leave Nielsen a lot sooner.

### Company being aligned with my values

The main driving force behind leaving Nielsen is that the company does not align with my values. I am not sure what the company's stated mission is, but from working inside Nielsen, I can tell you that Nielsen helps create an eco-system that gives large corporations the ability to take advantage of individuals. While Nielsen, might say that they are helping consumers express their preferences, that is not accurate. Nielsen is funded by large corporations. Because Nielsen is paid by their clients, in the end their main priority will always be making those clients happy.

Nielsen provides corporations with the information they need to get consumers to buy more of their product. I believe Nielsen has the opportunity to be a truly amazing company. A company that uses it's panels to understand more about the human condition and what drives decision making. Nielsen does have incredible data and that data is very powerful. The power of this data is currently not being unlocked at all. This data is being used to marginally help the revenue of the largest corporations.

During my time at Nielsen, I realized how important it was for me to care about the underlying mission of the place I work at. It is important for me to wake up every day and be excited about the company I am working at and the impact that company is having. All jobs will have really exciting parts and parts that are tedious or boring. When the underlying company mission speaks to you, all of those tasks are much more enjoyable.

### Company structure and culture

Nielsen was a difficult place to work because of how large a company it was and how hard it was to get anything done. Data Scientists at Nielsen sit so far away from the product. During my time at Nielsen there has been a lot of work to fix this, but this is an inherent problem of working at such a large corporation. There is so much that needs to happen for any change to be realized. With a large company it is impossible to make changes quickly. After David Kenny came in as the CEO, I thought he was saying all of the correct things, but did not see that change filtering its way down to my level. I think this was due to a lack of change at the middle management or upper management level. Here is an [article](https://onezero.medium.com/speaking-truth-to-power-reflections-on-a-career-at-microsoft-90f80a449e36) from James Whittaker that talks about how important it is to have change in the middle leadership of a company.

Nielsen is stuck with a culture problem where people are not empowered to make a real difference. There are a lot of great people at Nielsen who say all of the correct things, but overall the company is too large with too much going on. For Nielsen to be successful it is necessary for them to shrink down their scope immensely. They need to put their employees in the best situations to succeed and be empowered. Nielsen is much to centralized as an organization.

I believe that the a company will have the most success when it is organized around decentralized cross functional teams that oversee a project from beginning to end. Currently at Nielsen, different departments over see a project during different parts of it's life cycle. When a certain segment of a project is finished, one team throws it over the wall to another department. It would be a much better structure to have cross functional teams that own a product from beginning to end.

People talk a lot about work-life balance and Nielsen has a great work life balance. Nielsen allows employees to work from home and has very good hours. I believe less focus should be on work-life balance and more focus should be on work-life integration. Your work should give you energy and make you thrive in the other parts of your life. You should not feel the necessity to separate the two and protect one from the other. At Nielsen it does not seem like most people are passionate about their job and that their job is gives them energy. This is why they find work-life balance to be so important. When you are not passionate about your job, you need to ensure a work-life balance. On the other hand when you are excited about your job, your job will give you energy and make all the other parts of your life better. People are not passionate at Nielsen because it is difficult to be passionate about consumer insights.

## Why I am excited about working at Change

From the above it might be pretty clear about why I am so excited to be working at Change. Change is different from Nielsen in all of the aspects I have talked about above. I am extremely passionate about improving american democracy and helping democratic candidates make better decisions using data. Change is a start-up where everyone works together and sits close to the product. All of the people at change are extremely passionate about what they do and care a ton about the company's mission. Change is literally the size of one cross functional team. I could not be more excited about starting this new chapter in my journey.
