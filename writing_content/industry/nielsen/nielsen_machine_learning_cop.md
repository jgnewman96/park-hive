### Project Description

The Machine Learning community of practice was a one stop shop for all things machine learning at Nielsen. The goal of the organization was to provide resources related to machine learning. We recorded all of the different projects being worked on related to machine learning, who were the different machine learning experts in different fields and maintained general learning resources.

We hosted monthly webinars that highlighted different machine learning projects around the organization and provided a forum for practitioners to present their work and get feedback. We also had a website that contained lots of resources about general machine learning resources and machine learning information specific to Nielsen.

### My Contribution

During my time at Nielsen I was on the Machine Learning CoP Council. This meant that I was in charge of helping to make sure the Machine Learning of practice was a helpful resource through out Nielsen. During my time on the council there were two main initiatives that I led.

#### Study Groups

I find that the best way to learn is learning directly from other individuals and learning together as a group. Having a group to study with makes it more enjoyable to study and holds you more accountable. While anyone can dedicate the time to work on their skills using resources from the internet, working together with a group of other people is a lot more appealing. During my time on the council I set up study groups in different Nielsen offices to improve machine learning skills. The goal of the study groups was to learn by getting hands-on experience with machine learning. The study group would identify some area at Nielsen that could be helped by machine learning and then come up with a small side project they could work on using machine learning. In this way they were working on an actual project for the business and learning more about how to apply machine learning.

#### Technical Skills for Non-Technical Leaders

Some of the leaders in our data science organization recognized that their technical skills were not as strong as they wished. They reached out to ML CoP expressing that it was difficult for them to learn on there own and if we could help them set up a study group. We decided that the most helpful thing we could do was actually build content / lectures / exercises for them to work. When you are a leader in the organization there are so many different tasks demanding your time. It can difficult to find anytime to grow your own skills and if you do it can be frustrating to do it in isolation.

We would create lectures for a group of data science leaders once a month teaching them about different technical concepts that would help them better lead their teams. We built these lectures to help give leaders the necessary information to ask the right questions of people on their teams.

### What I Learned

Working on the ML CoP was difficult at times. It was a side project I picked up outside of my normal work. The CoP did not have any funding and operated outside of the company hierarchy. At time it felt like no matter what we did things were going to stay the same. Overall, working on the ML CoP was very rewarding and it did seem like over time we were able to improve Nielsen's ML skills. Here are a couple of different lessons I learned during my time on the ML CoP.

* It can be very difficult to stay motivated when it seems like what you are doing does not make a difference. A good way to stay motivated is by creating a community that supports each other and is there for each other. The other members of the ML CoP council where the absolute best. Seeing their drive, work ethic and excitement also got me excited about other possibilities. It was also important to recognize when a project was no longer exciting and became draining. If the project was draining and we felt like it was not making a different then normally it was time to take a different approach.

* One very important thing I learned during my time on the council was how important writing user stories is. User stories is not only important for software development but anytime you are creating a product for people. We knew that there were different users with different use cases but until we wrote out user stories we did not have much clarification about who those different users were and what they actually needed. User stories allowed us to take an abstract idea and put it into concrete details and actually actionable information. The process of writing user stories is really helpful in better understanding the value that you can provide.

* Another important part of being on the ML CoP was learning how to identify when you want to build something yourself versus providing people with the tools to build something. We found with study groups, we just wanted to provide individuals with the infrastructure and communication to build their own study groups. By providing them with the tools they could actually build study groups that suited their needs the best. When we did the study group for leaders though, it was much more important for us to build out the entire study group ourselves. It was necessary for us to build the curriculum and the lesson plan.
