## What I Did at Nielsen
My first job after completing undergrad was as a Data Scientist at Nielsen. Nielsen is a market research company that provides insight about what people buy and what media content they consume. I was a part of Nielsen's early career program focused on fast tracking individuals to leadership roles. The program consists of four six months rotations for a total of two years. During my time at Nielsen I wrote about what I worked on and what I was learning. I wrote about each of my rotations and some side projects I took on.Â During my time at Nielsen I focused on building sustainable solutions and modernizing how we work. Below are the links for all the writing I did about Nielsen.

[Rotation 2 - Bayesian Inference for Ratings](#/post/nielsen_rotation2)

[Rotation 3 - Digital Pipeline Development](#/post/nielsen_rotation3)

[Machine Learning Community of Practice](#/post/nielsen_machine_learning_cop)

I left Nielsen after a year and four months to pursue an opportunity at Change Research. I wrote about why I was leaving Nielsen and why I am excited about working at Change [here](#/post/leaving_nielsen)
