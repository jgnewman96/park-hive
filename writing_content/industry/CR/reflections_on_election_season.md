Woof...... The past couple of months have been such a whirlwind. It has both been quite long and quite short. I guess that is just the way it goes. I have done a bad job of taking time to do personal work. You might have noticed the lack of posts since the end of September. That doesn't mean I have not been reading or writing. But, I have not set aside the time to take what I have been doing and put it on this website. Over the next few weeks you should start to see a bunch of posts trickling in. I have about six books to catch up on and five papers.

While it is still fresh in my mind I wanted to jot down some thoughts about what it was like to be working in politics for my first election season.If you want to check out one of the things I was working on, I built Change Research's presidential vote model. [Here](https://changeresearch.com/post/2020-presidential-model/) is where we released the model's predictions. As far as I know it is the most accurate model that was publicly released.

While working at Change is different than working on a political campaign, I imagine a lot of what I felt over the past few months is common with all people who work in the political sphere. The basic ethos at our company was "now is the time to put our heads down and deliver". This often meant working longer hours or trying to get something out the door even if it was not perfect. A presidential election only comes around every four years. Now was our time to make it count.

This attitude actually really negatively impacted my work experience. Not only was I feeling less enthused about work, but I think the quality of my work also deteriorated a bit. I am a firm believer that working more hours does not lead to getting more work done. But when there is pressure to get work done, that is an easy margin to adjust on. Engineering work is truly a creative process. It takes time and space to do things the right way. When I am working more hours it can often take me longer to get something done. I do not think the problem through as well and I make more mistakes.

We were constantly justifying decisions with the following logic:
> It is fine if this is imperfect right now. Let's get it out the door and we can make it better later on.

But this tradeoff was often a false one. Using the imperfect solution led to more difficulties later on and did not actually mean we delivered anything quicker. We were using that logic to justify doing worse work. Going through this election season has been a really good opportunity to explore that tradeoff. In general, I think it is better to take a little bit more time upfront.

During the past few months, I was often finding myself drained at the end of the day. I was not excited about going to work the next day and did not have a lot of energy. Part of this can be attributed to the above difficulties. Part of it can be attributed to other organizational frustrations. But a big part of it can be attributed to the lack of design that I was doing.

One question I constantly return to is "what gives me energy?" What are the activities that give me more energy after I finish them then when I started? These are the activities I should be seeking out. As I have grown in my career and shifted from a pure data scientist to more of a engineering role, I found that design is what gives me energy.

When I say design, I mean design at any size. It can be the first few thoughts related to a completely new project. Or how to design a quick bug fix. But when I am doing that creative thinking, that is when I have a lot of energy. Recognizing this makes me see the importance of finding design in everything that I do. As I was exploring above, it can be easy to put my head down and just focus on trying to finish something. But their truly is design in every thing that I do, no matter how large or small.

It is easy when I am frustrated about my current situation to think of grand changes and how they will make everything better. I have found that just a slight reframing or perspective shift can also have a large impact though. And maybe a more meaningful and lasting one.

Going forward I am going to look for the design and creative thinking aspect in every task that I do.
