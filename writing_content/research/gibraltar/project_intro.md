The first thing I do when I open my laptop is my most important task of the day. I plan out how am I going to allocate my attention for the day. This planning determines how the rest of my day goes. If I have clear focuses and direction, the rest of my day can be calm, efficient and peaceful. Sometimes when I devote less energy to planning and leave ambiguities, I will be playing catch up the rest of the day. I will be constantly re-organizing what I want to work on and will often spend my energy on things that I probably should not have.

My most valuable resource is my energy. When I allocate my attention to the correct places, my days feel rewarding and full. I leave the day with more energy than I started and I accomplished tasks that are important to me. When my attention is scattered across a number of different things, my energy depletes quite quickly. Context switching is a demanding activity.

It is important I segment my time between planning and execution. I find it difficult to be both executing on a task and doing planning at the same time. Similar to how it is difficult to write and plan a piece at the same time. It is a best practice to outline the writing, and then execute. This segmentation of time manifests globally for my day and locally with a given task. This is the reason I try to plan my day out at the beginning. It is also the reason I like to spend five to ten minutes at the beginning of any task sketching out my execution steps on a piece of paper. 

When I have done the necessary amount of planning, execution feels like a breeze. Even the hardest tasks feel accomplishable. But most of my days do not feel like this. About one to two days a week do I hit the sweet spot. Most days my mornings start well but then my afternoons often become distracted and energy draining. It would be really nice to turn more of my days into those energy increasing days were I accomplish my most meaningful tasks. 


Upping the percentage of my days that are energy increasing is one of the most important things I can do. It will make accomplishing tasks that are important to me easier.  Increasing those days will require some changes in my habits and processes. 

After talking with [Andy Matuschuk](https://andymatuschak.org/) about some of my struggles with energy and attention allocation he suggested I look into __Programmable Attention__. Programmable Attention is using a system to direct your attention towards high priority tasks. Moment to moment it is difficult and intense to decide where to allocate your attention. Instead of always making that decision, you can set some parameters / guidelines about how you want to make those decision in general. 

It is desirable to not be making attention allocation decisions in the middle of my day. Consider the difference between emotions in the heat of the moment versus when there is space to think. In the moment it is easier for emotions to be really strong. To get angry or upset and act in a way that you are not proud of. Later, when you are calmer and have more space, it is easier to recognize that you are not proud of how you acted and that you should have done something else. Programmable attention is similar. In the middle of my day it is easy to pick low impact / easy tasks or to let my attention get hijacked by something with a false sense of immediacy. Having a system that helps me stick to my principles for how I want to allocate my attention will help me spend my time inline with my values. 

Andy has written [some notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma&stackedNotes=zJrfPCbY7GcpV9asEc8NTVzXTAV4TvRFMuY6) himself about programmable attention. Ian tay's [intro to programmable attention](https://www.iantay.dev/post/programmable-attention/) is also a really good explainer.

## Current State of the World

Looking at the current state is always helpful when working towards improvement. Here is a breakdown of my current planning process and how I determine what to focus on.

My planning work is done in [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) Roam has a built in **TODO** functionality to create tasks. All of those tasks are listed on one page in reverse order of when they were created. I leave that page open on the right side of my screen in Roam at all times. Tasks that get added to this list are mostly important tasks that I have to do for work. I try to keep this list short (under 10 items) because having a lot of items can be overwhelming. Smaller tasks and tasks not related to work rarely make it onto this list

As I mentioned, at the beginning of the day I create a list of all the things that I want to do that day. This list includes both things for work and things not for work like, cooking, exercise or reading and writing. I will pull tasks from my TODO list and add them as well. Once I have everything I want to accomplish I sequence the tasks assigning a number to each of them. I then start with my first task. 

Whenever I start a task, I try to spend a little bit of time planning the scope of that task and how I want to accomplish things. I either do this directly inline in Roam or sometimes will do it on my [Remarkable](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2). 

This process is one that I have come to after some iteration with other processes. There are a number of things that work well, but some things that could be improved. 


#### What works well

-  My mornings are highly productive. I often put my most meaty and rewarding task in the morning and am able to work on it undistracted for a long period of time. There are a few reasons I think my mornings go so well.
1. I have just planned out my day and defined one task to work on. I am then able to work on that task for an extended period of time without distraction
2. My energy level at the beginning of the day is probably at its highest
3. There are fewer external distractions in the morning because the company I work for is based on the west coast. 
- Using my remarkable to take planning breaks is a really successful tactic. This will either happen right when I start a task or maybe ten minutes into working on a task.  

#### What does not work well 
- My afternoons are often really low energy. I spend time floating around between slack, email and other low priority tasks.
- Switching between tasks is a place where my attention gets taken up. When I switch between tasks often things that I had not planned for attract my attention.
- Tasks related to work get over prioritized. I spend more time then I want working on a deliverable for work rather than on thinking or writing or reading. There is more of a draw to work on these things because there is a deliverable. 
- There is a relatively high cognitive load of managing this todo list and making sure I do n0t forget to do things


## What can I change
I am a huge believer in using tools / the environment to nudge you in the correct direction. I have found that a distraction free space is critical to my ability to focus. Similarly, deleting most apps from my phone makes it a less distracting tool. The tools that I use have a direct impact on how I spend my time and what I create. In this direction, I think there are improvements I can make to my space through out the day. 

Roam is the software tooling that helps me organize my attention. I enjoy using Roam because it makes some organization a lot easier. In general, using a software tool is promising because it reduces the amount of cognitive work that I have to do. Once I have said this is how I want things to work, it will remember that. Just as spaced repetition is possible without using software, managing my attention is also possible. But software has the potential to make it a lot easier. With space repetition, All I have to specify is that I want to remember something and then it does the rest. Programmable attention is a bit more complicated, but I believe it could work similarly. I could specify this is how I want to allocate my attention and then the tooling would help me do exactly that. 

## How is this more than just a Task Manager? 

It is easy to think about attention solely in terms of tasks that we want to accomplish. In this piece I have mostly focused on ideas related to a productivity. But I believe the scope of this tool might be larger than just a productivity tool.  In addition to helping me accomplish tasks this type of tool might: 
- Help me better prioritize things that are actually important to me 
- Help me build creative ideas spaced out over time
- Help me know when it is time to abandon a project or something is not as interesting to me anymore.

## Next steps
1. Roam has built in functionality called the [Delta scheduler](https://roamstack.com/an-introduction-to-roams-delta-function-spaced-repetition/). The Delta Scheduler lets you schedule items to appear later in your notes. I am going to explore using the delta scheduler. 
2. Eventually I will  probably build my own application that helps me with this. Allocating my attention is one of the most important things I can work on and so having software that works for me seems like some of the best usage of my time. 
3. I also want to look into research about energy and attention allocation. Research showed that spaced repetition is a good way to learn things. I am sure there is research that has documented some best practices for attention allocation.
