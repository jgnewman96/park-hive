I am interested in how some of these visualizations, both the most recent ones about the training process and the ones used to visualize a trained model, could be used to improve the model training process. Is it possible that by providing these with end-users and them having a better understanding of the model is working we could improve the model building process. COuld we use these tools to better understand errors. If we look at an error and use this tool could we understand why the model is making an error and help make the model more robust?
