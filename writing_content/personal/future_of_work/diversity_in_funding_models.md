For the past few months my mind has been floating to a series of thoughts that seem somehow connected but it is not quite clear to me the exact connection. Generally they all have to do with the future of work and the future of education. But so far most of these thoughts have stayed quite abstract. I have discussed them with a couple of friends, but they are readily changing and evolving. I want to push myself to write about them in a low stress way. This will hopefully help me connect them and understand more deeply why I keep returning to these thoughts. Why is this something that continues to be top of mind for me?

When I was looking for internships the junior year of college there were two main possibilities that I saw for myself. I could either go work at a consulting firm or I could go become a trader at a financial firm. When I look back at these options both of them seem terrible. I think at both of these places I would have been quite unhappy. But why were they the only options that I considered? Part of this is probably unique to studying at the University of Chicago, but from [Marina Keegan's essay](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/30/even-artichokes-have-doubts/) it seems like this sentiment might also occur at other universities. These were the jobs that everyone was interested in! It only seemed natural for me to also be considering these jobs and trying to get them. Lucky for me, when I was applying to internships my junior year I did not succeed in getting any of these jobs. This lead to me doing computer science research with a professor instead. 

Looking back, it seems so odd that those where the jobs I was trying to get. Knowing what I do now, I would be really unhappy in those jobs. So why were they the jobs that I was attracted to? There are cultural and social reasons that those jobs are valorized, but what I want to think about now is the role that money plays in it. Both of these jobs are quite lucrative options. So many people are attracted to these jobs because of the salary that comes with it. As easy as it is to say that salary does not matter to me, I absolutely goal post jobs based on the salary that is attached to them. If a job has a higher salary attached to it I see it as more selective and more impressive to have attained that job. 

A bunch of college students were attracted to jobs by how much they paid, what a surprise. But focusing on this is actually really important. Even now I find it can be so difficult to break from the paths that I see a majority of other people taking (more thoughts on that to come). But when I was younger it was that much more difficult to do something different. Yes, plenty of people do it and I should not use that as an excuse, but structurally it is difficult. 

As a society we want to be directing people to work on that is of high value and that will help our society. Does working in consulting or the financial industry provide some value to our society? Maybe, but both of these jobs are mostly helping wealthy people get even wealthier. They are causing more inequality and not drastically helping anyone.

Funding impacts the type of work that people do in so many different ways. I was talking about the small ways it pushes students who have been taught to follow achievement to pursue certain jobs that are not high value. But funding impacts work in so many other places and so much higher up the stack then students trying to pick which companies to work at. I had the option to do CS research because my professor had received enough funding to hire undergrad RAs. If he had not received that funding then that position would not have been available to me. But funding also impacts whether or not certain companies are even created in the first place. 

If you want to start a new company it will usually involve taking on some sort of debt. If you are starting a small business that debt might be in the form of a loan from a bank, a friend or a family member. If you are creating a start up the predominant way you get it off the ground is be raising money through a venture capital firm. While venture capital has helped create lots of companies that do provide value, there are a lot of difficulties with the venture capital model. I am not well acquainted with this space, so I am sure someone else can write about it in more depth than me, but VC firms are looking an extremely large return in their investments. VC terms are not fine with just a modest return to their investment. Since VC firms are looking for huge returns they will mostly invest in companies with large growth opportunities. 

But there are many different businesses out there that might not present large growth opportunities that VC firms are looking for. Yet, if you want to start a company people know they have to raise VC funding. This puts people in the mindset of only thinking about ideas that present large growth opportunities. There are lots of ideas that are never pursued because their potential for growth might not be there. Founders need to know how their idea might turn into high growth before they pitch it. Ideas that would be modestly successfully and create a lot of value do not even see the light of day if they are not high growth.

Funding also plays a huge role in academic research. Part of the reason that academic research is so different than industry is because that funding model is so different. Research delivers returns on its funding in different ways. Rather than having to build a product that makes your founders money you have to create original research. The contract then switches from investing money to make more money to investing money to create original ideas. I am so glad that this different type of funding model exists. While it has problems of its own, having more diversity in funding leads to different types of ideas being created. 

Professors are constantly applying to different grants and trying to secure funding so they can carry out research. When a professor receives that grant it usually comes with some stipulations attached to it. You have to show the organization that gave you the grant that the money is going to good use and you have to deliver progress. This pushes researchers to find positive results and publish research when they might not otherwise. 

Also, if there is no grant for the type of work you want to do then tough luck getting funding for it.

Funding and resources provide the ability for individuals to pursue ideas and build ideas. When only certain types of projects or directions will receive funding then we are leaving an immense amount of exploration on the table. Ideas that could be valuable are never even explored. At first it might be that people have these ideas but then they do not receive funding so they end up working on different things. After a certain period of time though people will stop even trying because they know only certain directions are viable. 

If we want to maximize the different types of exciting and creative work that is happening in our society than we should look to create a large diversity in funding models. We should create many different ways for people to get paid for the creative work that they are doing. People should be able to work on ideas that do not have a clear path to high growth businesses. If we have more diversity in the types of ways that people can receive or raise funding then we will have more diversity in the types of work that actually happen.
