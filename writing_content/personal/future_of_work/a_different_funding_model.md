In a previous [post](#/post/diversity_in_funding_models), I started examining how funding and incentives related to money impact what projects people work on. Different funding sources are optimal for different types of projects.  If we want diversity in the type of projects that are being pursued, then we also need diversity in how those projects get funded. 

> When only certain types of projects or directions receive funding then we are leaving an immense amount of exploration on the table. Ideas that could be valuable are never even explored.

These thoughts on funding models are surfacing through thinking about what I want my own career to look like. What are the projects that I want to work on and how am I going to get them funded? 

The beginning of this post is self reflection about what I want my own career to look like. After concluding that the most common funding sources would not support the type of work that I want to do, I explore crowdfunding projects. I conclude by proposing a new model for crowdfunding based on using tokens and the implications this could have on labor.

I find it helpful to use my peers as guideposts for what I want my career to look like. One common aspiration among many of my peers is to build a startup. There are a number of reasons why this might be an attractive path for me: 


1. I would be working on something that I personally created rather than helping someone else carry out their vision. Part of that attraction is probably due to my ego. But a company that I build is more likely to be closely aligned with my personal values.
2. Not only would I be working on a project that I believe is important but I would be building a community. Building communities that allow people to flourish is one of the most rewarding things I can do.
3. I would get to learn about many different parts of building a business. My current and previous jobs have only spoken to a small part of the entire business. When building a business from scratch the founders have to learn about all aspects.
4. As a company grows the role of a founder constantly changes. This requires evolving and constantly learning a new role. A good founder is doing very different things when a company is 5 people, 20 people, 50 people and so on. 

While I am somewhat attracted to founding a startup, it actually feels like the wrong decision for me. Taking Venture Capital investment, which is the predominant way technology startups are funded, causes companies to direct energy away from delivering values to users.

When a startup is first created, the project is in the explore phase. The founders have an idea about how to create something valuable. They are exploring that idea and want to understand the value of what they are creating. That explore phase is the most exciting part of any project to me. Time in that phase is spent exploring fundamental questions and pushing knowledge forward. 

Since start ups have to deliver a return on their investment, they are forced to transition eventually from this explore phase to an exploit phase. VC firms only invest in projects that have an opportunity to bring very large returns. The exploit phase is about finding the best way to monetize and grow your product. In an ideal world this phase is about increasing impact by bringing your product to more people. From my experience though, companies measure their success not on value delivered, but on revenue and size of funding rounds. Since companies know they are measured by these metrics, they focus on optimizing them rather than  delivering value to users. VC funding provided the opportunity for the explore phase but also mandates that it eventually transitions into the exploit phase.

Having such a focus on creating a return on investment feels antithetical to what I want to be doing. For my own work, I would rather be spending time in the explore phase. I do not want to be spending time thinking about how to extract value from users, but rather how to deliver value to them. This means that I do not want to use VC funding on my own projects. 

---- 

Based on my preference for doing exploration work over exploitation work it would seem like getting a PHD and becoming a professor at a university might be a desirable path. There are a number of things that I do find enticing about that direction:


1. The most rewarding work I have ever done is when I was doing computer science research as an undergraduate. I was working at the cutting edge of how humans interact with AI systems. I was reading other researcher’s papers and building off of their ideas. It felt like I was truly working in uncharted territory and trying to help a field move forward.
2. Teaching has always been something that I find to be incredibly meaningful. There are so many teachers, both academic and not that I have learned from and who have inspired me. While most jobs involve some sort of teaching, it is desirable to have part of my job explicitly be devoted to it. 
3. Academic research is not motivated by creating a profitable business. The work does not need to create something that is immediately of monetary value. (This does not mean it is not tied to money in a perverse way though!)
4. Professors are regularly interacting with and learning from young people. College students have some of the most creative minds and have not lost their curiosity and excitement. 

While having a job in academia is quite desirable for the reasons I listed above, it also has a number of drawbacks. In academia, the biggest marker of success is whether or not you receive tenure. Tenure decisions are made almost solely on how prestigious your research papers are considered. Since tenure decisions are based on research papers, you're incentivized to focus on making as many papers as possible. That means researchers will focus on creating the smallest possible publishable unit of work or making incremental changes to existing work rather than exploring newer ideas. 

I also find research papers to be an unsatisfactory final product for a project. The majority of research papers are inaccessible and written for a very narrow audience. Since incentives in academia are tied to research papers, that is often where work ends. This means that academic research is far away from actual implementation. Researchers themselves often do not implement their ideas but are reliant on someone else reading their paper and pushing their work forward. Academic prestige is therefore not necessarily based on impact on society, but rather what other people in that small community think of your work. 

I mentioned earlier that I do not want to be working in the exploit phase, but there are a lot of desirable traits that have been developed in the exploit phase that are not present in academia. Companies in the exploit phase** **usually have an intense focus on the end user and delivering something that is impactful. No matter what type of work I am doing, I want to be focused on the impact of my work and making it as accessible to others as possible. 

Having spent time now working in both academia and industry (at both large companies and small companies) neither feels like it is a perfect fit. I want to be doing work in the explore phase, but still be thinking about users and directly pushing the impact of my work forward. I do not want to be spending my time thinking about how to extract value from users and how to deliver a return on an investment.

If neither academia or industry is a good fit for what I want to be doing, what other paths are there available for me?

[Andy Matuschuk](https://andymatuschak.org/) is an independent researcher who is carving a new path for himself. Andy’s research explores tools that support knowledge creation and retention. His current project is creating  a new reading medium called [Orbit](https://withorbit.com/). Orbit uses spaced repetition to help the reader better retain what they are learning. While I find the research that Andy is doing compelling, I am more interested in how he is funding that research. Andy is completely funded through crowdsourcing using Patreon.  In exchange for supporting Andy on Patreon, you are granted access to a subset of his writing.

[Andy has argued](https://andymatuschak.org/2020/) that the work he is doing is only possible because of this different funding model he has taken. If he was in academia he would be spending his time on research papers rather than creating actual software. If he had taken VC funding he would have to be devoting energy to monetizing what he is creating. This alternative funding model of crowdsourcing research funding through patreon has created a project that would not exist otherwise. 

In Andy’s[ own writing](https://andymatuschak.org/2020/) he has highlighted that his path might not be reproducible for all projects. His work is “obviously legible to casual observers” and therefore can have a very large reach, which is not true of all work. Having such a large reach means that Andy only needs to receive a little bit of money from each of his supporters. While Andy has found success asking for a small amount of support from a lot of people, that model might not be ideal for some other projects. 

If I believe Andy’s funding model (or something like it) is ideal for the projects I want to work on, then I have to find some way to reproduce some of what he has done. When thinking about my own projects in the future, some of them might not have a very large appeal. One project I have been interested in is building better documentation tools for machine learning practitioners. Creating tooling that makes all the different paths they tried and the hidden assumptions baked into their work legible for external parties. This type of project is not as understandable by a large audience and therefore might struggle to have a large reach. 

Not only will some projects struggle to have large audiences, but it might also be ideal for projects to have a fewer number of funders. With a smaller group of funders, the creator can have a more intimate relationship with each one. With a large group of funders you might barely have a relationship with any of them. Having a smaller group of people who funds you allows for a deeper and more intimate relationship.

For each project and for each creator the ideal number of funders is different. I am not aware of any projects funded with about 50 - 100 people. At 50 - 100 people it would still be possible to have a relationship with each funder. You could meet with them once a year and hear their feedback. But to only be supported by 50 to 100 people, the creator would need to get more support from each funder. 

There are many creators who have proven the success of crowdfunding to support their work. In exchange for the content they create, funders receive some service or product. I pay [Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/) ten dollars every month because I want to read his writing. I pay [Zeynep Tufkeci](https://www.theinsight.org/) ten dollars a month because I learn a ton from her. Similarly there are artists, video creators and many products that have had success using [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/home) or [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/).  This relationship of paying a creator for the content they produce through a subscription is quite normalized now. 

For me to pay more money to these creators, it would have to be an investment rather than paying for a service/product. I can buy an IPhone from Apple, but I also can invest in Apple. When I buy a product, that is money I am spending, but when I make an investment I am trying to grow my wealth. An investment would mean that I am a part owner of the creator’s project and as their project grew, I would receive a return for my investment. By turning my contribution into an investment, I am willing to contribute a greater amount of money.

If the amount of money received from each individual is larger the number of funders needed can decrease. Needing fewer funders makes projects that do not have as large of an appeal more viable.

With some tweaks on Andy’s current model it could support projects that do not have as broad of an appeal. I first formulated this idea while listening to a discussion between [Li Jin](https://li-jin.co/about/),[ Eugune Wei](https://www.eugenewei.com/) and a couple of others about building creator communities. In passing they mentioned using tokens to support your project rather than just monetary contributions.  I also recently read this [substack article](https://tals.substack.com/p/creator-daos) about “creator decentralized autonomous organizations”. Here is the important excerpt from the article explaining how tokens might be used to support a project

> For example, a group of people who wanted to design a line of shoes might sell tokens in their project to people who believed in their vision. These tokens would bestow several privileges on their holders. They might provide token-holders with discounted pricing and/or priority access to the project’s product. They could give token-holders the ability to vote on shoe designs or other project decisions. They might even provide token-holders with a share of profits when such exist. And of course, the tokens could be sold to other people for profit, if as a result of the success of the project the value of the token increased. In addition to cash, tokens might be earned through work on the project. Designers, marketers, manufacturing and financial experts could be awarded tokens in return for their involvement in the shoe project. Even smaller contributions, like helping a social campaign go viral or providing survey feedback on packaging, could result in token grants.

> So how is this different from crowdfunding like Kickstarter or membership platforms like Patreon? These three frameworks have plenty in common, most importantly, the goal of making it possible for more people to make stuff. But the main difference that a Creator DAO provides is the notion of ownership. You are not simply supporting a project. Through the token, you possess a piece of it. And, within the rules of its smart contract, are free to use the token as you want. You can sell it, stake it, fractionalize it, include it in an index, take advantage of all of the liquidity-enhancing mechanisms DeFi enables. In other words, with a CreatorDAO, in addition to wanting to help people make stuff because you like the stuff they’ll make, you get financial incentives. You are an investor. A true owner.

Here is what applying this model to a project like Andy’s would look like:


* Rather than accepting cash contributions every month, Andy would sell tokens to people. We will call these Andy Tokens or ATs. 
* There is a generative process for ATs. Creation of ATs would be similar to other crypto currencies. A unit of work generates more ATs. With bitcoin, new coins are entered into circulation through mining, rewarding miners for their computational work. For Andy’s project, whenever he does a unit of work, he gets rewarded with new ATs. For simplicity we will say he generates 50 ATs for a month of work on his project. 
* Andy can then sell these tokens to people who want to fund his project. Andy would determine the initial price for these tokens just as he determined he would accept 5 dollar contributions on Patreon. 
* When you own a certain percentage of ATs you get access to certain benefits. If you own .01% you get access to Andy’s writing. If you own over 1% you can meet with Andy once a year and talk about the project with him and give feedback. 
* Since Andy generates new tokens every month, to keep your percentage of tokens constant you can buy a certain percentage of new tokens whenever they are created. 
* This setup also provides an opportunity for people to own tokens through non monetary contributions. If someone contributes to Andy’s project they also generate some new tokens. 
* It also creates the opportunity for people to own tokens and sell them to others. Rather than only being able to buy from Andy you could buy tokens from another person who already owns some. People who value the tokens more can pay you for them. 
* This setup also provides an incentive for people to support you earlier in your path. When you support someone earlier in their project, you are taking on more risk, but you also have a greater chance for reward as the value of their tokens goes up. This could make it easier to have funders at the beginning of your project.

Projects that are funded using the above model have different incentives then the other funding sources I have already explored. This model means the creator can be less focused on monetization and growth, and not be driven by winning the approval of her peers. By changing the monetary incentives that come with our work, different types of projects might emerge.

What would Facebook or Google look like if they were not so focused on growth and monetization but rather on delivering value to users? Switching these incentives is essential for building a society that is not focused on revenue, profit and prestige.
