A year ago when I was interviewing to work at [Whisper](https://whisper.ai/), I had to do a product sense interview. I was asked to think of a product that I was excited about and which I could discuss in depth. In that interview I brought up the writing platform [Substack](https://substack.com/). I gushed about the possibilities of Substack: it would allow writers to directly connect with people who valued their content. Writers would be their own bosses, have better work lives and explore topics that would not get covered at a larger publication. Substack would create more niche publications that would not be available otherwise. [Monetary incentives impact what type of content is created](/#/post/diversity_in_funding_models) and by connecting writers directly to their readers creators are pushed to do work their readers value.

A year later, the impact that Substack might have is becoming clear. While some writers have found success on the platform, many writers have found running a publication on the platform to be difficult. Writers who have thousands of subscribers are able to capture more of the value they create than they would working at a big publication. But, for some writers running their own publication is quite intense and can lead to [burn out](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/11/11/a-good-newsletter-exit-strategy-is-hard-to-find). After trying Substack, some writers have decided to leave Substack for a bigger publication like the NY Times or the[ Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/introducing-subscriber-newsletters/620579/)

While Substack has created some new opportunities, we can still push the relationship between writers and readers in even new directions. We can learn from what has been successful about Substack and improve on some of the things that Substack has struggled with.

* * *

I am going to touch on three places where Substack feels limited. Understanding these struggles will help frame what other solutions could look like.

1. **Running a business by yourself is really difficult.** When a writer uses Substack they are out on their own. Even though Substack provides tools and support to help run a newsletter, there are many tools they do not provide. The writer has to do the hard work of writing, but also of promoting their publication. There are real advantages that newspapers or journals derive from bundling writers together. Not only is it good to share resources (e.g. editing, marketing) across writers but having colleagues is an important part of meaningful work. Colleagues provide feedback on your work that improves the quality of what is produced. Helping colleagues and being a part of a team can be as meaningful as the work you are actually doing. Running your own business can be isolating.[ Every](https://every.to/letter) is a writing collective exploring a space in between these two extremes.

2. **Norms about how often pieces should be published** Most newsletters on Substack publish multiple times a week. That is such a large amount of content for one person to create. Personally, I have unsubscribed from most of the Substacks I got excited about because of content overload. It is unclear to me why newsletters feel the need to publish content so frequently, but making good content is a difficult process that takes time. Publishing so frequently can actually be value destructive. This frequency standard seems to be carried over from traditional news outlets. The role of news publications used to be conveying that an event **had happened**. With social media, publication’s role is no longer just saying that an event happened but providing perspective on what the event means and what the implications are. This type of work takes a lot more time than just stating that an event happened.

Content being published so frequently also destroys the value of previous posts. A reader will not have time to read previous posts if they can not even keep up with all the new content that is being created. While Substack does have archives, I would bet that most readers are not looking back through the archives. It is not surprising that having the expectation to publish so often can lead to burnout.

3. **Framing the relationship as a consumption good**. Newsletters are currently framed as a piece of content that we consume. We are paying for an object, the writing piece, and then we as readers consume it. When we think of something as a consumption good it is easy to fall into the trap of wanting more. The more there is for us to consume the better! Who wouldn't rather pay for a publication that creates 4 pieces a week than something that creates 2 pieces a week?

A different potential framing is that what we are actually supporting is the creation of knowledge. We invest in someone to do work that otherwise would not get done. The writing piece is just the way that knowledge becomes accessible and shared with others.

This framing implies that when I support a project it is not because I want a good to consume, but because I believe the work the person is doing is important. Turning that work into something that others can understand is important, but that’s not what I am paying for. It is possible the work gets shared in other ways besides just writing (audio, video, presentations).

Changing the framing from that of purchasing a consumption good to making an investment provides different incentives for the writer. It is less about creating as many goods as possible, but instead they can focus on doing their work as effectively as possible.

* * *

Using the limitations of Substack as a jumping off point, I am going to propose what a different setup could look like. This proposal is about re-imagining what organizations look like and how we can improve on some existing structures. When thinking about new organizations we want to change incentives to improve outcomes for both readers and writers. We want to help writers find situations where they can do meaningful work and be compensated for that work. 

One structure that might provide new opportunities is a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Ownership of a DAO and the work done by the DAO is coordinated using [tokens](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-token). A helpful mental model is that a token is simply proof of an event. What that token proofs can be many different things. In this DAO, ownership tokens are generated when progress on the DAO's projects is made. The DAO makes its progress legible to outside groups in any number of ways such as blog posts, seminars, audio or video.

People can support the DAO and be part owners of the DAO through tokens. Ownership stake in the DAO corresponds to how many tokens you own. Owning tokens will bring with it certain benefits. Owning x% percentage of tokens provides access to a subset of content. It might also give access to events connected to the DAO or access to some of the work that the DAO is doing. People who want to support the DAO or access the content it is creating are incentivized to purchase tokens. Purchasing tokens not only gets you access to some content that you want, but it also means you now own part of the work. 

Ownership means that the incentives of readers and writers will be better aligned. Being a part owner means you want the organization to succeed and for tokens to appreciate in value. 

***

For the DAO to actually be an improvement over current structures it is necessary that the token generation mechanism supports the right incentives. An organization that is coordinated using tokens is not inherently better. But because tokens allow coordination to happen in different ways, they create new possibilities for how an organization might operate. Here are a couple of options for how tokens might be generated

_Option 1_. **A fixed amount of tokens are generated at a fixed cadence**. Core members in the DAO are working on projects. Every month they create X tokens for the work they do. Those X tokens are proof that progress was made on those projects that month. Core members can then sell their tokens to others to be compensated for their work. Owning y% percentage of the total token pool gets anyone access to certain benefits. The token price is initially determined by the core members who are creating tokens. By selling their tokens they are selling their ownership at a certain price. If people are willing to pay more money for the tokens, then the value of the tokens will increase. Anyone who owns tokens can then sell them to anyone else at any price they wish.

Using a scheme like this could remove the incentive to publish more frequently. The amount of tokens that are generated is fixed. The main incentive is to do work that others deem as valuable so that others want to own / support the organization. Others will learn about the work through the content the DAO makes, but making more content does not make the work more valuable.

This scheme could be thought of as paying a fixed salary. That salary is determined based on how much people are willing to pay for tokens. It removes the incentive to focus on creating as much content as possible because the number of tokens that are generated is fixed. 

_Option 2_. **When the DAO makes their work accessible to others, it is created as an NFT (non fungible token)**. This NFT can then be sold to others. You would need to be above a certain level of ownership to interact with the piece (above x% to read the piece, above y% to comment on it). Rather than buying ownership of the entire body of work, others can buy ownership of individual aspects of the work.

In this setup, value is directly tied to when the work becomes legible to others. While this might seem like it incentivizes publishing more often, it hopefully will not because different pieces can have different values. Since each piece is it's own NFT, others can directly signal how valuable they find each piece to be. A piece that people do not value, might never get bought. A piece which people value a lot could increase in price a lot. This would mean it is more worthwhile to publish something really good infrequently than things that are less valuable more frequently. This scheme has similar properties to[ retroactive funding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html) because people are signaling how valuable they think the work is, after it has already been completed. Buying the NFT is subsidizing and supporting future work that is similar.

This scheme might be quite powerful since others can directly signal which aspects of the work they find to be the most valuable rather than having to pay for all aspects of the work.

Imagine you have written a book, rather than selling copies you sell tokens that represent part ownership in the book. Using tokens in this way allows for many different possibilities. You have to own x% of the tokens to read the book. There is some extra content that is only available for people who own above y%. After you have read the book you could re-sell your share if you want. If you are only interested in certain chapters, you might only need to buy those chapters. 

[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is a platform that is making NFT publishing possible. 

_Option 3_: **Use tokens to coordinate which work gets done in the future.** The DAO will make collective decisions about what it is going to work on. Everybody who owns tokens in the DAO gets a vote on what work the organization will work on. This incentivizes owning tokens because token owners have a say on what the organization works on. 

This mechanism could be seen as similar to[ Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/). Purchasing tokens funds work. Token owners influence what work gets done by the organization.

The most successful approach might involve a mix of the different options. Different types of projects might be more successful using one option rather than another.  A hybrid approach could have tokens which determine ownership and coordination in the DAO as a whole, but then some individual pieces are sold as NFTs. Having ownership stake in the DAO gets you access to certain perks and owning some of the NFTs also gets you access related to those specific pieces.

So how does this new model try to improve upon what Substack has done?

1. Working in an organization with others can alleviate some of the difficulties of creating something on your own. Being a member of a team can also often provide meaning that cannot be gained doing something alone. For some, doing something on their own might be the right solution, but for a lot of others it will be preferable to be a part of something bigger than just themselves. Working with others does incur coordination costs though. The goal of using tokens is to diminish some of those coordination costs. Tokens make it easier for groups to coordinate and contribute in different ways

2. The DAO's focus is not on creating as much content as they can. The focus is on doing work that others deem valuable. Using tokens historical work's value may not get destroyed by new content being constantly created. The DAO is building on historical work to continue making progress on their projects. This switch in focus could help decrease burnout by not requiring the constant creation of something new.

3. Using NFTs and tokens allows more precise signaling of what aspects of the work people value. Different people might value different parts and they can directly signal which parts they find valuable and how valuable.

4. Growing the DAO is not only about how many people it reaches but how much each person values it. Substack or Patreon have different tiers, but using tokens allows support to be a lot more fine grained. Someone who values the work a lot more can have a larger ownership share

5. When you make an investment and then own part of something it is easier to justify paying more money. Rather than requiring a small amount of money from thousands of people, you maybe only need to convince a hundred that they want to be part owners of the DAO.[ Nick Quah had a newsletter that he recently sold to the Verge](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/09/hot-pod-the-podcast-industry-newsletter-will-become-the-verges-first-paid-product/). If you had part ownership in a DAO, if it got sold you would make some money from that sale.

I started this piece talking about Substack and writers, but it might be clear from my language that I think this DAO structure applies to more than just writers. I believe it could work for many different types of work. It could apply to artists, filmmakers, or even researchers.

Using tokens to coordinate ownership does not inherently lead to better results. It is critical for the DAO to find a token mechanism that works for their project and goals. In the DAO space there will be trial and error with different structures and the correct structure for different projects will look different. Hopefully though, using tokens can allow for new organizations that create better alignment with the creators and the people who value their work. This alignment hopefully improves the work lives of the people in the DAO by providing a financially stable way for them to work on projects that are meaningful and rewarding.
