How optimization is a good analogy 

there is a space that we want to optimize 

we want to find the ideal career, the ideal life partner, the ideal city to live in. 

All of these can be thought of as an optimizaton problem. 

There is a space over all possible outocmes. You could marry any partner, life in any city. 

In order to the ideal one you have to do some exploration. As you try something you learn

if you like this keep heading in this direction, if you did not like it keep heading in a different direction 


we can learn even more from the nuances of optimization


# local vs global optimum 

explain in terms of optimization, have a photo 

what can we learn from this 

you need some randomization and trying things in far off places 

you do not want to get stuck in a local optimum 

# learning rate

explain in terms of optimization 

how much you update based on what you learn 

you need to tune your learning rate 

your learning rate whill change. 


## finite amount of time and explorationg during explotation 

we each have to understanding the trade off we are making 

Conclusion 

analogy  is not perfect but it provides insight and forces us to think in different ways 

thinking about finding a partner as mathematical optimization can seem gross 

that assumes there is an optimum and does not take into account all the nuiance 

but it does have some lessons. Like it is important to have some experence with some different partners. 


as all algorithms and data need there own learning rate and experimentation so do all people.
