During this entire quarantine I have been going over and over in my mind what I want to write about. There was apart of me that knew I wanted to write about something related to the quarantine. It feels like one of the most momentous moments in my lifetime. I often use writing as a medium to think through things and writing a piece about my experience feels like something that is important to do.

But writing about my own experience always felt hollow. I have been truly blessed with my experience during this quarantine. I have always been well fed and quite safe. I am not at risk of losing my job. Quarantine has actually been an opportunity to grow closer with the people I am quarantined with. In some positive ways quarantine has allowed me to experience things I otherwise would not have.

So If I cannot write about my own personal experience, then that leaves me with an analytical piece. I could write something about all of the bad social science that is happening or about how modeling and predicting is so god damn hard. But writing an analytical piece also feels hollow in a lot of ways. It feels so devoid from the ups and down of the actual experience of quarantine. While I have been truly blessed with the safety I have experienced during my quarantine it has not always been an easy experience. My emotion goes up and down and often the downs can be quite low.

During all of my reading during quarantine I have found that the most powerful pieces are those that come from the heart. The essays and pieces that are the best are the ones that really come from the heart. It is the pieces were you can tell the person cares deeply about something and it connects througb out their entire life. It is not just something they are writing about because it is topical. So here is my take...

So often I am focused on my contribution what can i bring, what are my original thoughts. Rhonda and how often the best role I can play is to to necessarily bring my own orginal perspective. It is not what matters here. The role I can play is to listen and hear the voices of others. To amplify the voices of others.

I remeber the first time I was presented with the idea that America is not the greatest country in the world. I was in late middle school or maybe it was early high school and the show The Newsroom was about to come out. There is a clip from the pilot LINK, where Will Mcavoy, played by Jeff Daniels goes on a rant about why america is not the greatest country in the world. Growing up in a family that always watched one of Aaron Sorkin's other show, The West Wing, I ate the clip up instasntly.

For me at that time it seemed like such a radical thing to say that America was not the greatest country in the world. In my schooling up to that point everything had been so American centric. I had learned about slavery, the civil rights movement, but these things were never talked about in juxtaposition to the rest of the world. WHenever I learned about civil rights growing up it was such a distant thing. The focus was on the heroes of the civil rights movement rather than the actual pain caused.

So why did I latch on to this idea that America was not the greatest country in the world. No matter who were it seemed like thinking america was great was important. Liberal or conservative we always had to hold up our country. Saying the pledge of allegiance in school. supporting the United States in the olympics. It felt like a different take out of the political combat between liberals and conservatives.

We will return to this clip a little bit later.

I have been reflecting a lot during this quarantine on personal baggage. My reflections on personal baggage did not start during this time but they have become more intense. I was listening to Still Processing and Wes and Jenna brought up the importance of dealing with trauma.

A lot of the books I have read also focus on dealing with personal baggage. Washington Black, Coates Water Dancer,

I have recognized on a personal level about how this is something I need to get better at and something that is so important. We carry around these small things with us and let them impact our actions in so many different directions. We bring things from previous relationships previous jobs and they continue to impact.

But baggage does not only occur on the personal level there also exists baggage within communities. Baggage with familes baggage within friend groups. If this bagge is not dealt with it stays around.

But that second part is missing. It goes to this idea that America used to be the greatest country in the world. That the current place is different then what it used to be. This is the rhetoric that trump uses too, make america great again.

One thing you will notice about is that they are african american. Having to deal with baggage I imagine is mort important because they are faced with.

reading this, I thought it was such a good essay.



riz ahmed the long goodbye, who actually built the country, we return to the country.

one of the reasons that the U.S is always built up is because of this idea of the American Dream. The U.S. is supposed to be the land of opportunity. Anybody can come here and succeed.

But that is not actually the case. The American Dream is specifically something that is built up to make people who are rich feel better about themselves. If this is a place where you can work hard then anyone who has made has done so because of their efforts. Because they are special. In the American Dream world, the people who make are special.

But the American Dream ignores that there is so much luck in this. Also the people who make it rich are the people who come from rich families. It ignores the immense amount of poverty in our country. The American dream is something that specifically keeps people who do not succeed down. If there is the possibility for anyone to be succesfull here then it means if you are not then something is wrong with you.

false idea of the american dream

 Managers are paid to leverage their advantages, not destroy them; to increase margins, not obliterate them. Culture more broadly is an organizationâ€™s greatest asset right up until it becomes a curse.



the us was an integrated solution:
 the U.S. gave up its flexibility and resiliency in favor of top-end performance. Intel is one of the most advanced chip makers in the world, but it turns out that capability is far too constrained to its own needs to be of general applicability

 Eugene Wei: An under-examined implication of these sayings is that a poorly run business with a great business model can flourish for long stretches in a degraded state. Or, a business might be terribly run but financially great.

Systems sustain themselves in a degraded state until a sufficiently strong stressor breaks them, overwhelming all those duct-taped solutions and jerry-rigged ramparts.

for america to grow up we need to reconcile our history and our past. We need to recognize what we have done, what our country is to move forward
