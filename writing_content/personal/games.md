Jenny, my wonderful partner in crime and teammate, had her birthday last month. I got her a Nintendo Switch, with the game [Overcooked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overcooked). Overcooked is a cooking simulation game. You are in a kitchen with other chefs and you have to collaborate to make customers dishes. While simple in concept, Overcooked is quite deep in how it forces you to work together. The levels are set up so that the only way you can succeed is by delegating and working together. This aspect of collaborating is so essential that researchers at [U.C. Berkeley](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/10/21/coordination/) actually used the game as a model for building agents that can work with humans. Jenny and I have been playing the game together over the past month and it has forced me to reflect on how I work with other people.

Playing Overcooked has highlighted some of the ways that I struggle to work with others. During gameplay, I will often just expect the other person to know what I am doing or understand what I am thinking. Rather than communicating what I am trying to do, I just start doing something and then am surprised when the other person does not understand. This is a problem that I also struggle with in contexts outside of a cooking video game. I will expect that the other person is on the same wave length as me, rather than communicating my thoughts.

Another tendency I noticed is that I break from the script. We will have decided a division of labor that works, but sometimes I will feel like I can do more, and do something else. My teammate is expecting a certain behavior from me, and so even if I am recognizing an extra opportunity to contribute, if I do not communicate it, our system breaks down. Once again, rather than communicating with my teammates, I am just playing my own game and expecting them to adapt as necessary.

I also at times struggle to trust my teammates. I do not trust that they are going to do, what in my mind, is the right thing. I am expecting them to make a mistake or preparing for when they do make a mistake. An essential part of being a good teammate is trusting your teammates and putting your faith in them.

Reflecting on Overcooked gave me a lot of areas that I can grow in all contexts. I believe this is one of the best parts about playing games. While yes, we play games because they are fun and they connect us with others, they can also often be insightful. One of the largest benefits I have gotten out of playing Frisbee is learning more about myself by being on a team. I have learned more about forming a inclusive community and being a good leader. I have learned about creating strong bonds with your teammates and how important it is to become friends with them. Playing frisbee has taught me so much about all aspects of my life, not just the playing sports part.

While I have known for a while how much I have learned from playing frisbee, playing Overcooked made me reflect on how the the places I struggle in a game can often mirror the places I struggle in real life. Now that Overcooked made me see that, I also see that all over the place in Frisbee.

In Frisbee, I also struggle with expecting people to do certain things and expecting people to understand what I am doing. When players do something different than I am expecting, I can struggle. I also often try to do too much when I play Frisbee and sometimes do not trust my teammates as much as I should.

I believe that playing games is an important thing for everyone to do. Whether it is playing a team sport, playing board games, or playing video games. Games give us the opportunity to learn more about ourselves in contrived situations. It is hard to recognize your own weaknesses in your day to day life. It can feel like a falling of you as a person and hard to change. But we often do not feel like that when we fail in games. We know that it is something that we can work on and get better at.

Games also help us recognize that just as I can get better at Overcooked by explaining why I am cooking rice instead of chopping fish, I can also improve other interactions in my day-to-day life by improving my communication.
