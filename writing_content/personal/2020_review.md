2020 looked nothing like I would have imagined when I was writing my 2019 in review. 2020 reminded me how incredibly privileged I am. This past year was such a hard year for so many people. Whether it was loved ones passing away, financial hardships or just emotional well being and stability. While 2020 was very different that I imagined, my safety was never challenged and that is something I am incredibly thankful for.

2020 forced all of us to recognize what we previously we might have ignored. 2020 put the differences the racial inequalities  in the United States on full display. It showed that the United States healthcare system is completely broken. While 2020 was an incredibly challenging year, I am hopeful that we can learn from what it exposed and work to make a more just and balanced society.

Personally, 2020 was a difficult year because it made me more internally focused. In many ways I am an introvert. Being around a lot of people can be draining. I value my alone time and having quiet time. But because my natural tendency is to be introverted, 2020 pushed me further in that direction. I felt my energy drained being on large zoom calls with friends. I found it difficult to be on work calls for a lot of the day. But pushing me more internal actually was really difficult. Even though I have introverted tendencies I find the most meaning when I am able to connect with others. 2020 was not easier because I am introverted, it was harder because it pushed me more out of balance.

I will return and expand upon this idea of balance in a little bit below. Having a more internal focus led to me doing more reading in 2020 than I ever have before. I also did more writing and work on this website. While I am proud of all of that work, I want to push myself towards spending more time with others and connecting more with others.

The previous two years I have done a year in review by looking back at the books I read. I found all of my favorite quotes and compiled them into one piece. Writing that review was an opportunity to bring together the common threads of my year into one place. I was able to identify trends in my think that I was not previously noticing. This year, I have already written summaries of my notes on all the books I read and what thoughts they elicited in me. I went through those notes and picked out a few different topics that occurred a couple of times.

**Trauma**

I reflected a number of times on trauma and history. A number of pieces I read looked at how our individual histories keep impacting us and coming back to affect us. Even if events happened a long time ago, they are still impacting how we think and move through the world. I choose to use the word **trauma** because we have a more solid framework around it. We understand that traumatic experiences can still affect our emotions. But I want to expand the scope of how we think about what trauma is and the impact of our personal histories.

Our history is something that is constantly impacting us. Whenever we make decisions or act in certain ways, we are calling on our history of experiences to help us. That history can be helpful but it can also be harmful. When we face an experience,  we use similar historical experiences to guide us. This can happen both consciously but also unconsciously. If those historical experiences are still relevant, that can be a useful exercise. But we also can bring the baggage from our previous experiences and it can blind us to what is actually in front of us. We might feel more insecure in our current romantic relationship because of other previous relationships.

The most difficult part to understand the impact of our history is that we are not always conscious of the ways it is impacting us. In our head we might have a narrative about why we are making a decision, but that narrative can miss the impact of our history. It takes an active effort to recognize that we are feeling a certain way because of a historical experience. Once we recognize this, we can then ask ourselves is this feeling valid or actually detrimental.

**Growth v Balance**

Before this year, I was all in on the idea of growth mindset. I was constantly thinking about the ways that I wanted to improve myself. But this year has forced me to recognize that a growth mindset might not be sustainable. That type of focus will not lead to long term happiness and peace. By focusing on the ways I wanted to grow, I am also subtly critiquing the person that I am today. I also never had a fixed target of where I wanted to be. How much growth was enough? I could make progress on some things but then still want to make even more.

Instead of focusing on growth, I am looking for **balance**. Balance is not a passive resting place though. Balance is a constant moving target. Everyday there are external forces pushing us in different directions. Those forces could come from your work, from what you read, from other people's opinions. Balance inherently understands that we will never be finished. We have to accurately understand where we are today and adjust accordingly. Some days we might be off balance in one direction and other days we will be off balance in the opposite direction.

**Strengths v Weaknesses**

Our strengths and our weaknesses are tightly intertwined. This year helped me understand that I do not have certain things I am strong at and certain things I am weak at. The things I am weak at are directly related to the things that I am strong at. Strengths cannot exist without weaknesses also existing. This understanding allows for a deeper picture in thinking about my own identity and makes it easier to accept my own weaknesses.

Related to the idea of balance, I am not going to be able to just remove weaknesses and add strengths. When I have a strength, I also have a weakness that is connected to that same trait. Understanding this gives me a fuller picture. What I had previously framed as a weakness is actually connected to something that I view as a strength. This allows me to better understand where that weakness comes from and how to work with it rather than try to get rid of it.

**Community**

The people that I surround myself with is one of the largest determinants of my direction. In the balance section I mentioned how there are external forces that influence us. One of the largest ones is the people that I am interacting with regularly.

While individual relationships are important, this year has made me reflect on how community can be even more powerful. A community is larger than just individual interactions with different people. Community shows the power of a group of people coming together united about something. The communities principles or mission become larger than anyone one person.

One of the most difficult parts of 2020 has been how it is harder to have community.


**The Opacity of Others**

It is easy to forgot how hard it is to truly know what is going on with someone else. Many of the books I read touched on both the difficulty of understanding others and how others might have difficulty understanding you. We have such a deep relationship with our own thoughts and identity. We do not come anywhere near having such an intimate relationship with others as we do with our own thoughts. This asymmetry can make it difficult to recognize others for who they really are. We build stories about others and make assumptions about what they are thinking.

It requires constant effort to try and understand someone else. We should not expect others to understand us unless we communicate with them and we must provide others with the space to communicate about themselves with us. This requires having different standards and expectations for ourselves then we have with others. I want to push myself to communicate what is going on with myself as much as possible while also expecting that others will not necessarily share themselves unless I provide the space for them.


**Work Balance**

After this year I recognize the importance of having more distance from my work. Before this year I probably would have said that my ideal schedule would be working about 5 hours everyday rather than having a weekend. After this year I think it is really important to have long stretches of time where I am not thinking about work at all.

There were many nights this year were I lay awake not being able to fall asleep thinking about work. I was thinking about how to solve some problem or what I had to get done the next day. I was unable to quiet my mind and get the distance from work that I needed. When I was able to get away from work this year, it was such a respite. When I took a few weeks off it felt like such a weight off my shoulders. But even when I took a few weeks off, it took about a week before I really felt like I had distance from work. When I spend so much of my time working, it can be really difficult to get away. It is not about just not working, but also having ample time for work to feel like it was not recent.
