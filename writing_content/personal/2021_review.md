The beginning of 2022 feels a lot like the beginning of 2021. I am in Baton Rouge spending quality time with Jenny's family. We are mostly staying together since Covid is on the rise again. But while my current physical situation is similar to that of last year, 2021 was a much different year from 2020. One of my big focuses for 2021 was spending more time outward facing.

## Community and Friendships

During 2020, I spent most of my time in Baton Rouge with Jenny's family. While the first year of covid passed safely, I struggled with how far away I felt from friendship and community at times. There are a few different places I put in effort in 2021 that have been really rewarding. 

* I started a book club with my friend [Madison](https://www.thegirlandthelamb.com/). This book club has been so rewarding. It has been a way to connect with some of my friends and to read different things then I am used to. It has challenged me to think deeply about books in a different way. Because of book club I feel less pull to writing [book notes](#/medium/book). Since I am reflecting on these books with others, it satisfies the same itch. Book club has been so much fun because it both has strengthened my relationships with the people in the book club as individuals as well as forming a community that I feel like I am a part of.

* Jenny and I moved to Cambridge, MA this year because she started her PHD at MIT. Moving to a new city meant that we are now far away from a lot of the friends we have previously made. This meant we had to work at making new friends and forming connections. After a little less that half a year in Boston, it feels like we have made some really good friends that I am excited to continue spending time with. I love connecting with new people.The beginning of a relationship contains so much learning and understanding about fundamental aspects of another person.

* Since I graduated from college a few years ago, I have been struggling with what a friendship looks like. Until I graduated college most of my friends were people that I saw on a regular basis. They were people who lived in the same place as me and did the same things as me. But as my friends started to spread out and pursue their own directions that meant a lot of the people who I cared about live far away. This year I have finally started to feel secure and comfortable in what friendship looks like when I live far away from others. Jenny and I spent a lot of our summer visiting friends and it was great to reconnect with people I have not seen in a while. 

* After moving to Boston I started volunteering tutoring math at a local public school. Volunteering is something that I have really wanted to do more of and I am glad that I have found a way to do that through [Boston Partners in Education](https://bostonpartners.org/). Working remotely it is easy to not be as attached to my immediate local surroundings. Volunteering is a great way for me to meet and learn from people who I otherwise would not interact with on a daily basis.

* Jenny and I have gotten really into practicing Ashtanga Yoga. Slowly over the past few years I had been doing more and more Yoga. Most of that was following youtube videos. In Boston, Jenny found a yoga studio that we really like and a teacher who teaches Ashtanga. Ashtanga is a little bit different than some other main stream yoga. It is the same practice every time. Ashtanga is really challenging but it feels good to work hard at something with a community of other people and slowly make progress on it. I really enjoy all the other people who have been practicing with us and the weekly ritual of going to yoga class.

All of these changes in the past year have made me feel a lot happier and secure socially on a day to day basis. Working remote means that I am not seeing people face to face as much and so it is really important for me to have the right social outlets that bring connection and fulfillment. 

## Phase Transition

The past few months have felt a little bit like a phase transition in Jenny and my life. The past three years since we graduated from college have been one section in our lives and we are transitioning to the next one. The past section involved Jenny and me understanding our relationship better and what it will look like going forward. It was about us learning how to take care of ourselves and how to live a healthy life. We were able to explore living in a few different places and working at a few different jobs to get a better understanding of what things are most important to us. 

Now that Jenny has started her PHD, we are going to be living in Boston for the next few years. While we still have much to learn and change, it feels like we have built a really solid foundation. We have learned a lot about ourselves, what we are passionate about and how we want to move through the world.

Now that we have these building blocks in place, it feels like both of us can start being ambitious in some other areas. Jenny is exploring what it means to do economic research and complete a PHD. I feel very solid in my career at Whisper and am excited about the work I am going to continue doing there. I have learned how to balance my work life with some pursuits outside of work and the importance of having those other pursuits.

Using this base, I have some goals that I want to pursue in 2022. These goals are ambitious so I would not be surprised if I do not meet all of them, but I am excited about being ambitious with them.

## Goals

* My main project outside of work is going to be [Repeated Generator](https://repeatedgenerator.netlify.app/). I am exploring how I can improve my own writing practice and idea generation process.
* For the past couple of years I have flirted with reading textbooks. I never found a good method to read textbooks and maintain the knowledge I was reading. Towards the end of the year I started using Spaced Repetition and I think that holds promise for making reading textbooks more rewarding. I have a couple of textbook reading groups I am trying to be in this year.
* This is the year I finally get my drivers license. During the holidays I have been doing some driving in Baton Rouge and should be able to get my license later this year in Boston. 
* By the time I am 30, I want to make some serious progress on learning Chinese. I do not know what serious progress means, but it feels like this year I should at least start developing a plan for learning chinese.
* I spent some time in 2021 thinking about [career funding](#/post/diversity_in_funding_models), the [long term future of my career](#/post/a_different_funding_model), and what [organization](#/post/substack_limitations_and_dao_possibilities) I want to be a part of. I want to continue doing that work and thinking about it with other people.
