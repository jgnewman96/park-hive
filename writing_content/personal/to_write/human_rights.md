The importance of social insitutions
- reading the book 
- thinking about social institutions across countries 

we think a lot about social institutions hyper locally, 

I will talk about that briefly 

how do we think social insitutions across countries or people we do not come into contact with frequently. 

is climate change an opportunity to unite cross nationally 


Uighur's

immigartion camps

need a policy that we can follow and think about

focused on things going wrong in this country

when actually so much worse is happening in other countries

why do we prioritize our own country over others?
- why are these people more important

can we help other countries when things are going wrong in our own country
