If we have truly reach a point of saturation in the tech sphere than venture firms should stop investing in tech and should be looking in a market that is not saturated that would turn things on its head.

In this piece I will lay out a line of thinking that brings us to this point

### Here is a model of Business and paradigms

- the diagram
- there is a current way of doing things and then something switchs 
- Irruption -> frenzy -> Synergy -> maturity
- There is an argument to be made that this is not the case but this seems very spot on to me 
- I have not actually read the book yet, but I am excited to

In a new space there are so many opportunities to reach venture funding because the possible returns to scale are so massive.

### Where are we currently 

- there is a very compelling argument to be made that we are in the maturaity stage 
- the tech ecosystem is set up. We have the larger players, the google, the facebook, the amazon, the microsoft
- They are so fundamental to the ecosystem now i see a hard time seeing them being disrupted
- people use facebook / twitter / google as the distruption netwroks 
- use amazon / microsoft / google to build things

The new companies in the tech sector are probably not going to compete with these guys, they are going to be built on top of them with the assumption they are going to exist. THis is how business are built

### If we accept that model for technological change and where we currently are 

- venture should not continue to be investing in tech companies 
- they are going to really struggle to have the times of retun that venture wants
- we see evidence of this happening Softbank and other companies not growing as large

Venture should be funding things focused on the next innovation
- to me a huge one is related to video games

people actively participating and enganging rather than just passive like movies

### There is also an opportunity to connect smaller investors 

there is still huge opportunity for there to be lots of flourishing in the tech space

tech invites so much opportunity 

the problem is if everything is looking for venture returns then that limits a lot of structures 

you need a business plan that makes you as huge as possible

Instead we need to set up a different type of funding network. 

Should be peer to peer that allows people to fund what they are passionate about and not need as large growth.

We quite easily have the infastructure to make this possible. Think about crowdfunding but make it slightly different. 







But there are plenty of great opportunities for really good investment if it is just individuals looking for smaller returns

If ben Thompson is right about this, there is a different market for an investment that should happen, peer to peer investment in smaller amounts

This is a point that I think is missed regularly: if you believe that the Internet offers an opportunity to challenge an incumbent, success comes not from replacing the incumbent directly but rather from transforming the entire value chain

Iâ€™ve been making the case for a long time that the natural endpoint is likely very large platforms and Aggregators on one-side, and a flourishing ecosystem focused on niches on the other, but implicit in the latter is that venture capital is not simply unncessary, it is actively harmful


some possible places were venture should be looking these are really just guesses 
  - video games
  - virtual and artificial reality
  - blockchain
