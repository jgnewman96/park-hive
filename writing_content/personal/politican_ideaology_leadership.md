We have been taught to support political candidates whose ideology most nearly matches our own. While being ideological aligned with a candidate is important, not enough weight is given to candidates other traits. As an organization grows larger, the success of the organization is determined less by the vision or execution of the leader and more by the leaders ability to listen and empower others. The United States political system is so large and unwieldy that the impact of a president is not felt through their ideology but their ability to successfully run a large organization.

During primary season I have had so many discussions about which candidate to support. These conversations always center on candidate's view points about policy. During the Democratic Primary there was a popular Washington Post [quiz](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/quiz-which-candidate-agrees-with-me/) that tells you which candidate you should support. The premise of the article was that through answering a series of questions about different polices, we can identify which candidate to support. This article represents a broader trend in political discourse. All of our discussions are focused on policy.

During the Trump presidency there has been a lot written about polarization. Many scholars have highlighted how the U.S. and other Western Countries are more polarized then ever before. This entire discussion focuses on where we stand on a scale going from liberal to conservative. Candidates are boiled down to a point on a spectrum. This person is a socialist, this person is ultra conservative, this person is more centrist.

Political ideology is closely tied with personal values. Choosing a candidate that has similar policy ideas to you often means choosing a candidate that has similar values to you. While picking a candidate whose ideology aligns with your own is important, we focus to much on each candidate's ideology. We determine who would be a good leader based on their idealogy. In a smaller organization the ideology and vision of the leader matters more. For leaders in government there are other factors besides ideology we should be considering more.

We are going to step away from government for a second to better understand why an intense focus on policy hides who will actually be a good leader.

Imagine we are picking the leader of an organization. The type of organization does not matter, it could be a start-up, a non-profit, a school science project, etc... We want to pick a leader who is going to make our organization as successful as possible at accomplishing its mission. To start, lets imagine our organization is quite small, it is only one person. What are we looking for in a leader of our organization? If the organization is just one person, we want someone who has a good vision and is going to be able to execute that vision. I want someone who is a hard worker and who has good ideas.

But now, let us change the task slightly. We are still picking the leader of an organization but the organization is two people instead of one. While this organization is still quite small, if the organization has two people,  our ideal leader slightly changes. We still want someone who has a good vision, but we also want someone who is good at listening and working with others. We want someone who maximizes the other person in the organization.

Now lets jump to an organization of 5 people. It is even more important that our leader can listen to others. We want a leader who has good organizational skills and can run a team successfully. The leader has to be good at facilitating group conversations and resolving disagreements.

As our organization gets larger the skill set of an ideal leader changes. We become less concerned with the individual's point of view and more focused on how they maximize the entire organization. Imagine an organization of 30 people (still considered small in most places). Our leader needs to be empowering the workers on the front lines to be making smart decisions. The people on the front lines have the most information and a good leader sets up a system so that she can learn from them. In a larger organization it is critical that the leader is good at hiring talent. The larger the organization the more different things matter than the leaders individual opinion. The success of a large organization is not determined by the leader's vision but by her ability to listen and empower others.

The government might be the largest and most unwieldy organization that we have. There is both the federal government and regional governments. The government was built specifically so that all the different parts do not work well together. Regional governments limit the power of the federal government. Our government was purposely divided into different parts so that no one part has too much power.

History shows that the structure of government limits our ability to get things done. Barack Obama was in office for eight years and he was really only able to focus on getting one thing done, Obamacare. Our government was built so that it is not easy for everybody to work together.

If we were starting from scratch, we would think about picking the leader of our government in a very different way. Yes, we would still care about their personal ideology, but we would be less focused on it. There are many politicians who have ideologies that are close enough to our own. Rather than finding the candidate who has the ideology that most closely matches ours, we would be trying to learn more about how candidates operate. We would want a candidate who listens and recognizes there own limitations. A candidate who can admit when they are wrong and hires great staff.

If we were less focused on ideology and more focused on these other characteristics we might be interested in the following debate questions.

 - How do you get information from your staff?
 - How do you handle when someone challenges your opinion?
 - How do you think about who you are hiring?
 - Is there a possibility that some of your policy ideas are wrong?

We can essentially think about the presidential election as a hiring process. We are hiring a candidate to run our organization. We have a couple of months to learn more about the candidates for the position. We do not only care about what our candidates product vision / policy positions are. We also care about how they work with others.

Reframing picking a candidate in this way helped clarify a lot of things for me personally. It makes it a lot clearer why Trump is such a bad person to be running this country. Not only are his policy positions detrimental, but he is not a good leader. He can never admit when he is wrong and is very difficult to work with. He is terrible at hiring the right people.

One last thought. While the ideological views of the leader may not matter as much in a larger organization, I am interested in exploring how it is important to have other people in the organization who are ideological leaders. Other people who are focused purely on ideological movement and driving ideological change. Think about AOC or Bernie. They have played such an instrumental role in moving the democratic party. While that might not be the role of the leader, it is still necessary to empower ideological leaders. I am excited to flesh out these thoughts a bit more.
