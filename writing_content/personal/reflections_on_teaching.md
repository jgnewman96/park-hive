My partner Jenny recently started her PHD in economics this fall. Over the past couple of weeks she completed her first round of tests. One of Jenny's big takeaways was that she should smooth out her studying. Doing a lot of studying in the couple of days leading up to the test is not a strategy for success. The classes that she had put the most time in earlier in the semester, were the ones she felt the most prepared for. This is especially the case if our goal is to learn the material well, but also applies if our goal is simply to do well on the test (which it is currently for a lot of students). 

Jenny's experience reminded me and made me reflect on my own history of preparing for exams. Every test that I have taken I have done some version of cramming for. Not only was this a bad technique for success on the test, but it meant I did not learn the material. I also found that cramming increased my stress levels and made me feel more nervous going into the test because I was acutely aware that I could have studied more. Being nervous for a test might be as detrimental as knowing a bit less material. 

The solution of spending more time earlier in the semester so you do not feel like you need to cram is a really admirable one. It is a strategy that does not feel that accessible to me. I also imagine it is a solution that most students would not take. This got me thinking about how I would design a course where students did not feel the need to cram and instead were incentivized to learn the material deeply and dynamically. 

* * *

First some principles about how I think about the purpose or role of a course in a students education: 
* Every course is going to cover some common material for all students. But a good course will also allow students to explore their own interests. The goal of a course is to help students accomplish some goals of theirs. Every student has different goals and therefore the course has to be dynamic enough that different students can have different takeaways. 

* Students should leave the course with confidence and excitement. Students should never feel like they cannot succeed. 

* If the course has to be graded, it will be possible for every student to receive a top grade. How to get certain grades will be transparent and standards should be very clear to students. Grades should not be centered on scores and rather focused on feedback to help students.

* Students are incentivized during the entire course to do things that will help them learn. If I was teaching a traditional class then I would use grades as an incentive mechanism to help students learn.

* It is important for students to give feedback to the teacher about the class. The class is meant to serve the students and one of the best ways to make sure that is happening is by asking the students directly. 

* During the course students will have to interact and work together. The class should help students form bonds with each other and learn to work together.

Now some design mechanisms I would use in the class to achieve these goals
* The class would be focused on projects rather than short term problem sets. There would be two large projects. One project in the first half of the semester that involved more guidelines and direction. A second project that is free form and allowed students to go in many different directions. Students would then present their projects. The first project would be presented to small groups and the second project would be presented to the entire class. 

* Each project would be individual, but it would involve some collaboration with others. You would get extra points for giving feedback to your class mates on their projects and for receiving feedback from your class mates.

* Each student would get extra points for coming to office hours, or scheduling 1:1s with the professor and TAs. 

* There would be auxillary readings that students could get extra points for reading and writing about.

* The in person time of the class is less lecture based. There would be interactive group activities as well as some individual reflections. More traditional style lectures would be made available online if students wanted to use them. 

* Spaced repetition would be an integral part of the course. Students would get points for completing their spaced repetition cards each week. 

* There will be a bi-weekly survey that checks in with students about how they are doing, what was most helpful and what was least helpful.

This piece was an exercise in how I would design a class that could still be taught at a modern day university. That means there are a lot of constraints in how the class could be structured. Another separate and interesting exercise would be to design an educational experience without any constraints.

I want to recognize two professors in college whose classes incentivized learning above all else. Both [Ging Cee Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gingceeng/) and [Averill Leslie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ave-leslie/) taught classes with unconventional formats, but they were two of the classes were I learned the most. A lot of the ideas in this post are inspired by them.
