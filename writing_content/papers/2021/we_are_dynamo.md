## Paper Motivation
By lowering barriers to communication the internet should make collective action easier. While these barriers might make it easier to gather, there has been evidence that the internet makes it harder for collective action to succeed in the long run. 

## Paper Contribution
The authors study online collective action through engaging with Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers. Through a year of ethnographic work they attempt to understand online workers' unique barriers to collective action. The authors then  created Dynamo, a platform to support the AMT community in forming a publics around issues and mobilizing.

### Background
The authors argue that the internet is a double edged sword. The same things that make it so easy to gather also make it difficult to make real progress on collective action. 
    
AMT is an online labor market for microtasks. Crowd workers perform small digital tasks for monetary compensation. AMT is different than other labor markets as contracts are incredibly short and the work force is quite diverse. Turkers have to weight collective action against personal risk to their worker account as AMT is a crucial source of income for many of these workers. 

People who work on AMT (Turkers) have created a few different communities outside of the platform. On these platforms they discuss well paying employers and educate newcomers. Some small scale collective actions have occurred on these platforms but long term collective action has been difficult to sustain. 


### Methods 

The authors research process was:
1. Look for existing forms of collective action by reading publicly visible forums
2. Find some workers who are interested in collective action. The authors interviewed over 100 Turkers in total.
3. Work through a design session with Turkers where they proposed scenarios related to collective action and received feedback

After this process the authors built Dynamo a platform that helps AMT workers organize. Dynamo is designed to gather ideas and energy supporting collective action. Turkers nominate issues for change and make concrete steps to act on them. By working with Turkers in the design of Dynamo the authors on three affordances for the platform 

1. Trust and Privacy 
- Turkers wanted safety from external retribution. They were expecting retaliation for their actions from Amazon or AMT requesters. This meant Turkers needed to gather in a way that could not be tied back to their worker account. The authors achieve this by creating a Dynamo HIT on AMT. When a worker completes the Dynamo task they get a onetime code to sign up to Dynamo. Turkers were also given randomly generated screen names. 
2. Assembling a public 
    - Dynamo focused on short idea pitches so that it was easy for many people to be engaged on the platform. 
3. Mobilizing
    - Once an idea gets upvoted to be a campaign then users can talk about it. Each campaign has one dedicated thread. 

### Successes
Dynamo was deployed on the web and in six months around 500 Turkers registered. Turkers have discussed 22 ideas for action and two have transformed into active campaigns. Rhe first active campaign was to curb poor academic research practices. They drafted a publicly available ethics guidelines to guide IRBs and requesters towards better behavior. The other campaign was to write letters to change the public perception of the people who work on AMT and to humanize them. 

### Failures
The authors found that publics which act are much more difficult than publics that gather. The authors identify two main difficulties that inhibited collective action. 

        
**Stalling** 
Using a voting mechanism to begin campaigns lead to a lot of initial excitement. It easy to be a part of something by voting. But when action and effort was required the movement slowed and people became less interested. If that slowdown was unaddressed the action would not proceed. The authors named this lack of momentum **stalling**. Stalling would also occur when next steps were difficult to identify or required too much work from one person

**Friction**
Friction occurred when someone in the community raised issues with the current direction. This would come in the form of general criticism without constructive suggestions to move forward. 

Stalling and friction are inherently linked. Efforts would stall when friction accumulated. Trying to avoid stalling by making a decision could result in friction.

### How to move past stalling and friction 

The authors found that when facing friction, actions by a trusted actor could help move the action forward. They developed the following four actions to turn friction into progress
1. If the collective action is stagnating propose deadlines for the current goal 
2. Use an act-and-undo strategy where actions can be done without consensus but also easily undone if there are lots of objections 
3. Work with organizers to portray an image of success
4. If an effort is in conflict repeat posts that have more natural language or remove topics that bring unnecessary tension

## My Closing Thoughts

I really appreciate how thoughtful this paper was and the importance of the platform that the authors built. Dynamo is a platform that might not have been built in any other way besides this research paper because the incentives do not exist to create it. I love how much the authors included Turkers in the process of building the platform and that they became so immersed in the AMT community. 

But besides really enjoying the overall idea, I did not vibe with this as much as I thought I would. It felt odd that the authors focused on this ideas of stalling and friction and make the paper about collective action in general. In a lot of ways this paper felt more natural as a design paper rather than a collective action paper. I would have loved to hear more about there process of building Dynamo, how to build similar types of platform and what their iteration looked like.

The other thing that was disappointing about this paper was how surface level the focus on collective action felt. The authors set up the paper by highlighting the intricacies of AMT. That not only is collective action on the internet different than collective action in the real world, but AMT proposes certain difficulties for collective action. But the two concepts the authors focus on **stalling** and **friction** happen everywhere! They are part of collective action no matter what. At work every day I face difficulties related to these two concepts. And the solutions that the authors suggest are already practices we know from what makes a good work place. Having structure helps make stalling harder because their is less ambiguity. 

The other disappointing part of the paper was that the authors did not include any photos of Dynamo. I am really curious about what the platform looked like. It feels like in a lot of ways this paper needs some __maintenance__. In general, a forgotten part of academic research is __maintenance__. Authors will propose their research paper and then move on. Sometimes they will continue work on projects related to that paper and then produce another paper. But the original paper is just an artifact. If you go and find the original paper their is nothing telling you that a new paper now exists that is more up to date. Papers just feel like they do such a disservice to research and limit the possibilites of what good research looks like. Authors should be pushed to maintain their papers and keep them up to date.
