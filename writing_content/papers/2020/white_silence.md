The paper explores why white people are silent when talking about race. It argues that this silence, "White Silence" functions to maintain white power and privilege. The goal of the paper is to unsettle the complacency that often surrounds White Silence. TO motivate silent whites to stop being silent.

Whiteness is dynamic, relational and operating at all times and on myriad levels. It is not something simple and not easy to wrap our heads around. We often think we know what racism is and can easily point it out. Racism also operates on many level and can be difficult to identify.

DiAngelo argues that not contributing one's perspectives serves to ensure that those perspectives cannot be expanded.Silence is bad because it holds up the status quo. White silence has to be considered in context to understand how it is detrimental. Due to the historical role of whiteness silence continues to enforce racism. The same action is different towards different people. Talking over a Black person is different than talking over your brother.

There is no one way for whites to engage that will be effective in all contexts. You must be continually grappling with how to best interrupt white privilege. Anti-racism work specifically challenges us to respond different then we normally wouldIt is critical to support those who have voiced a perspective we support.

> Seeing oneâ€™s patterns of engagement as merely a function of a unique personality rather than as sociopolitical and coproduced in relation with social others is a privilege only afforded to white people

To paraphrase the above quote, whites have the privilege to focus on our personality rather than how society has conditioned them.

White Silence comes from racism being seen as individual acts of meanness and people not wanting to be seen as racist. A big part of white silence is protecting oneself from being challenged. In the context of race discussions silence is inarticulate and offensive. We must have the courage to put our integrity to do the right thing above the possibility of repercussions.

## Thoughts


This quote below highlights the importance of doing active anti-racism work and doing it continually. Having an understanding of a concept is different than being able to act on it. I see this all the time when trying to learn a new concept. I might read about the concept and be able to understand it in theory. But then when I go to apply it, I struggle mightily. This is why it is so important to actually put the things that we read about into action. Only through trial and error can we see deeper than just a high level intellectual grasp.

> We may have an intellectual grasp of the dynamics, but awareness of racial inequity alone is not enough to trump our participation

The way this paper handled argumentation was very intriguing. DiAngelo proposed  possible counter arguments then explained why the counter argument was flawed. It is always nice to read papers from different fields and see how they prove their points in different ways.
