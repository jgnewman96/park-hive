## Summary

The authors of this paper use interviews of 14 data scientists to characterize how a data scientist takes business requirements and turns it into a project. The authors call this process of taking a clients needs and turning it into an analysis plan **_initialization. _**The authors specifically focus on how data scientists interact with non-technical clients. 

In the paper, clients asks are broken into three categories: high specificity, medium specificity and low specificity. High specificity is when the client knows exactly what they want and low specificity is when the client has a minimal idea of what they want to learn. The authors identify different tactics that a data scientists uses during initialization depending on how specific the client's ask is. 

## Thoughts

*   A data science workflow is often quite messy at the beginning. The project regularly begins with little insight into what the data is going to reveal. As the data scientist begins to interact with the data they learn new things and are better able to make an analysis plan. Data Science is a very iterative process in this way. The data scientist does not know what they are going to find. They do some research, make some findings, and then plan next avenues of research. 
*   Due to the data science workflow being messy, people often treat it as a very different process from an engineering workflow. Traditional engineering workflows, both software or otherwise, have best practices for planning increments of work, writing technical specifications, and defining success criteria. These best practices are things that data scientists should follow but currently do not. Just because there is a lack of clarity in the beginning, does not mean we cannot use the best practices from engineering. Using these best practices would help data scientists have more direction, ensure reliable quality code and speed up the development process.
