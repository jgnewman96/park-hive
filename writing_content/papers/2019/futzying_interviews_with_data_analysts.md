## Summary

This paper is a qualitative analysis of thirty interviews with data scientists about their data exploration process. The interviews focus on the different tools that they use, how they are used and what functionality data scientists still desire. The paper shows how different this exploration process can be for different data scientists and how they all use different tools. 

The authors define a structure for the data science workflow. The exploration phase comes in where the data scientist has a defined goal, but does not know how to solve it or what is in the data. The exploration phase consists of exploring the data and using the data to guide further direction. Exploration is how the data scientist transitions from general business problem to an action plan. 

There is a key tension between ease of us and power in exploration tools discussed through out the paper. Some data scientists find tools that have a lot of abstraction and are easy to use very nice, while other data scientists find them to be very limiting. The authors highlight how there is going to be this trade-off. The easier to use a tool is and the more it abstracts away from the end-user, the less customizable or powerful the tool will be. 

## Thoughts

*   This process of exploration is what makes the data science process unique. Other processes have some aspects of it, but it is truly front and center in data science. So much ends up being driven by the data itself! Thats fantastic and both scary. It is fantastic because it means less is grounded in our pre-conceived assumptions. Rather than making an assumption we can let the data tell us and guide us. But it is also scary because humans are not good at reasoning about very large datasets. Large datasets operate on a scale that is different to how we think. Without being careful and having some structure, it is possible to get completely lost working with data. 
*   One thing that I think this paper misses on, is that exploration is always happening in the data science workflow. It is not just one piece that happens and then we are done with it. There might be more exploration happening at the beginning of the workflow, but data science is constantly returning and doing more exploration. Exploration is such an iterative process. We learn something, try something out, learn something new and then return back to the data with a new understanding and direction. 
*   In this paper, some of the data scientists call for one system where they can do everything. To me this seems like a silly ask. There is never going to be one place where you can get everything done. Different systems are designed for different niches. If one tool focus on doing everything, a different tool will come along that can do one part better. This is why platforms, like our operating system, are so powerful. They provide the infrastructure for many different things to run on. This allows the user to pick the tools that are the best for them. 
*   In general, I do a bad job of recognizing how unique my own system of working is and that there are so many workflows out there. Everyone will have their own best way of working that maximizes them. There will be commonalties in what is useful but different people will want different things. Being able to optimize a tool for a given niche is really quite powerful.
