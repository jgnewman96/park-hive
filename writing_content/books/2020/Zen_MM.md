Before reading *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* I had no knowledge about what genre the book was or what it would be about. I actually potentially had some misconceptions about the content of the book. While I reading it, I actually thought it was a piece of fiction. Only when I read the afterword did I learn that it was actually semi auto-biographical. My friend Abhisaar recommended this book and I finally got around to it after about two years.

I quite enjoyed the entire process of reading *Zen*. I have not been exposed to much philosophy during my life and it was fascinating to read a first hand account of how an individual deals with different philosophers. It felt a lot more accessible then reading an essay or directly reading some of these philosophers work.

Even though Pirsig wrote *Zen* in the 50s, a lot of what he discusses is still relevant today. We are still struggling with our relationship to technology. We are actually probably struggling with it even more now. While some of the ideas he espouses have become a part of the main stream discussion, we are still grappling with a lot of the questions Pirsig writes about. This persistance of relevant questions suggests to me that things do not change as much as we might think. Even though our day to day might look a lot different then it did in the 50s, a lot of the issues we struggle with are the same.

In Fredrick Brooks paper, No Silver Bullets he highlights the differences between accidental and essential difficulties. [(My Notes Here)] ({{< ref  "/writing/papers/2020/silver_bullet.md"  >}} ). Essential difficulties are ones that are inherent, we will not be able to solve them. Accidental difficulties are ones we will eventually be able to solve. Using this lense, we might argue that struggling with our relationship to technology is an essential difficulty. Due to human nature and how technology changes and updates, we are always going to struggle to maintain a healthy relationship with tech. This view point forces us to reconsider our approach. Rather than solve this problem directly, we can recognize it is inherently difficult and be more understanding of those difficulties. When we stop trying to solve a problem, but rather recognize how hard it is, that can lead to a better relationship with the problem.

This also made me reflect on a discussion I was recently listening to between Tim Urban and Ezra Klein. They were arguing over whether we are entering a time that is going to be radically different from anything we have seen before. Urban was making the case that technological innovation is fundamentally changing our society. Klein had the perspective that technological change is often over hyped and things will not be fundamentally different. Framing this discussion as a dichotomy is the wrong approach. By taking the perspective of accidental and essential difficulties we have a better framework to think about this discussion. While some things might be radically changing, others might not.

The majority of the novel was focused on this idea of quality. While Pirsig did a lot of existential musing on quality, some of his reflections helped me reground my own sense of quality. It reenforced in me that in my every day happenings I know when I see quality. I know when I have done good work versus when I have not put my full effort into a project. I should maintain my own unique sense of quality and work on developing it. Developing your own unique sense of quality is an essential skill.

Pirsig briefly discusses where we derive our sense of quality. A more complete discussion of this would involve a mention of evolution. Pirsig mostly highlights quality derived from culture or individual experience. Our sense of quality in many things comes from evolution. This is easier to see in some realms and much more difficult to see in others. We know certain foods taste better because they are better for us. We like the taste of sugar because it give us energy. A higher quality food is something that is better for us evolutionarily. But in other places how our sense of quality is derived from evolution is harder to understand. How does the quality of an art piece derive from evolution? A possible line of thinking is that all of our emotions are a result of evolution pushing us to act in certain ways. When we see a painting, and it evokes a certain sense of quality, that is derived from evolution programming us in certain ways. Evolutionarily being on high ground and being able to see a lot of terrain was beneficial. Our perspective on what is a quality view, is a result of evolution. Thinking a painting is of high quality is equivalent of thinking a view is of high quality. As a result of evolution giving us emotional responses to different things, we have derived a sense of quality in all things. Our sense of quality derives from a combination of evolutionary beneficial traits and learned experience both individual passed down through culture.

In the book Pirsig uses a knife as a metaphor for how each person brings a different worldview. We all have a knife that we use to parse the world up into smaller parts that we can comprehend. Trying to understand the entirety of something is exceedingly difficult. Using a knife allows us to understand simpler parts. We all bring our own unique knife to each situation. There is not one definitive way to break things down, we each create our own subjective parts by using our own knifes. This metaphor does a really good job of explaining how we each try to handle the complexity of the world differently. We will never avoid having knifes, the world is too complex. We should strive to recognize our own knifes / perspectives and see how they are limiting us. Ideally we might be able to use multiple knifes to view any problem in different ways.

In a similar thought process, Pirsig reflects on their being infinite hypothesis. That for every problem there are infinite hypothesis about what might be the solution. If we accept infinite hypothesis we will never be able to rule them all out. Even after ruling out many possible ones we will still have infinite hypotheses left to test. Accepting infinite hypothesis forces us to reframe how we think about science. Science is not about finding an endpoint or a definitive solution. It is about finding balance. Rather than we making progress down a road, lets think of science as a balancing act, like a see-saw. One one side of the see saw is the complexity of life. The other side of the see-saw is human's understanding. As the complexity of our lives keeps increasing, we are working to learn more and keep the see-saw balanced.

Pirsig's decision to write from the perspective of an individual man at a given point in time made his thoughts much more accessible than writing an essay. Coming from an individual I found it easier to emotionally connect with his thoughts. When reading the voice of one man we know that his viewpoint is limited and do not need him to provide the entirety of the truth. Instead he is just providing one perspective which may be helpful or force us to reflect on our own thoughts in different ways.

## Quotes

> When I think of formal scientific method an image sometimes comes to mind of an enormous juggernaut, a huge bulldozer—slow, tedious, lumbering, laborious, but invincible. It takes twice as long, five times as long, maybe a dozen times as long as informal mechanic’s techniques, but you know in the end you’re going to get it.

> So I guess what I’m trying to say is that the solution to the problem isn’t that you abandon rationality but that you expand the nature of rationality

> In a sense, he said, it’s the student’s choice of Quality that defines him. People differ about Quality, not because Quality is different, but because people are different in terms of experience.
