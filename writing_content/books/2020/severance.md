*Severance* by Ling Ma is easily one of my favorite books of the year. *Severance* elegantly ties together many different genres. It is an immigrant story, a coming of age story, a story about heritage and an apocalypse story. Ma blends these different stories into one cohesive narrative. Often during apocalypse novels the majority of the focus is on surviving and how the world has changed. Tieing the apocalypse to an individual's history allowed us to explore how Candace's past impacted her actions during the apocalypse.

The present moment is a very relevant time to be reading this novel. Many of the facts about COVID-19 are similar to the fever in Ma's novel. It was actually quite eerie how similar they were. Ma did a good job capturing how people would respond to a similar virus. The similarity made me reflect on our current situation and the magnitude of it. While things are not as bleak as in Ma's novel, our current state is more similar to an apocalypse novel then I realized.

*Severance* has so many vivid scenes. I really felt the pain or anguish or excitement that the characters were feeling. I love reading about New York and Chicago. I find it exciting and comforting to read about someone moving through spaces that I also moved through.

Candance, the main character of the novel, reminded me of characters from Otessa Moshfegh's writing. Candance's description of her feelings felt similar to some of Moshfegh's characters. Candace's descriptions made it feel like certain events or experiences just happened to her. She did not have agency in controlling a lot of things. This reminded me of depictions from Moshfegh's novels.

After completing the book, I am still unclear about some of the messages from the book. I know that a book does not need to have one coherent message. But there seemed to be one passage toward the end of the book where Ma was really trying to drive a point home. It is the last quote at the bottom of the page. Ma seems to be critiquing living in cities. But what is she comparing living in cities to? Is she saying that living outside of cities is better? Could here point not actually be about cities but rather being a part of the system?

To complicate things even further, the character in the novel who is most anti-city or anti-system, Johnathon, is not portrayed in a positive light. Johnathon, Candace's ex-boyfriend, wants to leave New York. Johnathon does not have a regular job and is trying very hard to exist outside of the system. But it does not appear that he is any happier than Candance. If anything, he is depicted as distant and too aloof.

We can also connect these pieces with the actual fever in the novel. The fever causes people to be stuck in a repetitious cycle. They repeat the same pattern and actions over and over again. This idea of agency and being part of a system can be connected to how Candance and her mom are depicted. Rather than having agency things are happening to them. That the system is forcing them to go in certain directions.

So where does all of that leave us? Is Ma critiquing the systems we have in place that cause us to do the same thing day in and day out? Yes. Is Ma advocating for us to try and break out of that system? I am unsure. Maybe Ma is suggesting that it really does not work for one individual to break out of that system on his own. For there to be a real change it has to be at a societal level?
