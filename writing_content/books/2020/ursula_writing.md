__Conversations on Writing__ is a short book of three conversations between Ursula K. Le Guin and David Naimon about writing. One conversation is about fiction, one is on poetry and the last is on non-fiction. This conversations are quite in depth and show how Le Guin thinks about writing. Le Guin has published some of my favorite books so it was an absolute pleasure to hear about her creative process and how she sees the world.

Le Guin's knowledge of other authors was truly astounding. She is clearly a very avid reader and very conscious of where her work sits in the larger literary world. Le Guin has put an immense amount of thought into her writing and what she is trying to accomplish with it.

It has been a revelation for me writing some science fiction as an adult. Growing up a lot of science fiction was seen as novels for kids. These novels were supposed to be exciting for kids because they involve heros and magic. As an adult, I have found that most thought provoking novels to be science fiction. Science fiction provides a different perspective to view our own world. By looking through this different perspective we are able to reach an understanding that would not have been possible otherwise.
