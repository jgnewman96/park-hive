__How to Do Nothing__ By Jenny Odell is a meandering book focused on how to change our relationship with technology and those around us. While it would be easy to classify this book as self-help, it does not feel as sure of itself as other self-help books. Self help books often are written from the perspective of an all knowing author who has everything figured out and wants to share their knowledge with the feeble reader. __How to Do Nothing__ has a couple of key arguments, but it never feels like Odell is over confident or proselytizing about the correct way to life your life. Odell has some values and principles that she believes. She uses stories to convey how these approaches have helped ground her and helped her find meaning.

One of the frameworks that Odell talks about which I appreciate is bio-regionalism. Bio-regionalism focuses on connecting with your immediate surroundings. Get to know both the land and local community around you. Having moved every year since I graduated college, I have struggled to connect with my local surroundings. Knowing that I am likely to move again puts some resistance between me and investing in my current surroundings. I appreciated Odell's thoughts on bio-regionalism and it forced me to reflect on the ways I interact with my local community.

A thread that flows through all the book is the power of **resistance in place**. Odell describes how it can be attractive to think about resistance as getting away from something. We romanticize the idea of getting outside of society or rebuilding something from scratch. But this type of resistance is less powerful. We should resist without running away. Rather than getting rid of your phone because of your bad relationship with it, try to fix your relationship with your phone. We cannot run away from the things that we have difficulties with or that we want to change. We must find a way to interact with them on our own terms that aligns with our principles and values.

One narrative I have seen many times is that individual action does not matter. That recycling, or composting and changing my own consumptions habits in the grand scheme of things does not matter. That the scale of impact of an individuals' actions is so small, it is inconsequential. Another way you might see this narrative manifest, is that the most important thing you can do is vote. The argument is that voting has a much larger impact than any other action. While I understand this line of argument, it is one struggle with immensely.

It is true that my decision to bike rather than drive does not have a large impact. But, if everyone did choose to bike, that be quite impactful. I want to live in a world where people feel that there individual contributions make a large difference. The narrative that individual action does not matter also misses the effect of social pressure. If you live in a community were most people are composting then you are more likely to compost. When I decide to ride my bike, there is small impact of that individual trip switching from a car to a bike. But there is also the impact of other people seeing me bike and our society switching slightly more towards a one where people bike then one where people drive.

Thoreau’s ultimate hope was that if enough individual people decided at once to exercise their moral judgment instead of continuing to play the game, then the game might actually change for once

It’s also about control, since if we recognize that what we experience as the self is completely bound to others, determined not by essential qualities but by relationships, then we must further relinquish the ideas of a controllable identity and of a neutral, apolitical existence
