Wow, this book absolutely wrecked me. It is easily one of the saddest books I have read recently. It is a different kind of sad than other sad books I have read. Non-fiction often can be quite sad. But this book is just heartbreaking in how relatable it is. The stories are not wrapped up with nice clean resolutions. Characters do not always get redemption. The stories just really hit home.

Each of the stories in Jhumpa Lahiri's book center on one relationship. It might be the relationship between father and daughter, brother and sister or even two lovers. The book covers such a vast array of relationships with depth. There is insight into the relationship between parents and children, siblings and people on both sides of a relationship. It is a helpful reminder that similar types of complexity arise in different types of relationships.

Even though each story was quite different there were some common themes. All of the stories centered on people from the Indian Sub-continent living in the United States. The characters struggled with their relationships to their parents and their heritage. While none of the stories felt like they were directly about that struggle or tension, that struggle is deeply investigated over the entirety of the book.

The stories show both the diversity and similarities in experience of someone from the Indian Sub-continent living in the United states. This simultaneous diversity and similarity is quite powerful. It shows that we have to understand each of these people as individuals with their own struggles. But it also forces us to recognize that some problems and tensions are more universal then we might often think.
