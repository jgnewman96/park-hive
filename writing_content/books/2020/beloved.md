Beloved by Toni Morrison is truly a heart breaking novel. It builds up to that heartbreak in an incredibly nuanced manner. It does not throw you directly into what happened with Sethe or what her past is like. It tells the story from a couple of different perspectives with different pieces getting peeled back in different ways. The book keeps you unsettled by slowly revealing more information. This leads to a greater understanding of Sethe and why she took the actions that she did. The reader gets a deeper understanding of how Sethe's past is still impacting her.

The most powerful and interesting part of this book was how it reveals information. Books take many different paths to telling a story. Some are told from the present looking back at the past. Some are told as the story is happening in real time. What makes this novel so powerful is that it is a story about the present and the past at the same time. But when we learn more from that story in the past, we are also learning more about the story in the present. The story in the present is quite confusing and incomplete on its own. But as it gets intertwined with the story of the past we learn so much more.

Magical realism is such a powerful genre. The more I read it, the more I love it and the more I see how it opens up a new realm of possibilities in fiction. Beloved actually being a person and being embodied changes the whole flow and feeling of the story. We are able to feel how the past sticks around with us in a different way. When I read magical realism it often brings out an uneasiness in me. I know what is happening in the book could not actually happen in the world I live in. But yet the world of the book  is so close to the one I live in that it feels like it could.

Similar to some other books I have read this year, this book made me reflect on trauma. How the events of our pasts stay with us and continue to impact us. Even if we think we have dealt with that trauma it can still come up and rear its head in different ways. Beloved only manifested herself after Paul D showed up. Paul D showing up is probably a big reason that Beloved visited Sethe.

Beloved is a book that is often read in a classroom, either high school or college. I am curious how my experience of the book would have been different if I read it in such a setting. I imagine it would have changed my experience both because I was reading it with other people but also because of the nature of classroom discussions. Reading books with other people and talking about them is a really rewarding experience. I find that it can often deepen my understanding of the book and that other people's reflections make me think about things in ways I did not before. Thats part of the reason why I write these book reflections. They force me to reflect on what I have read rather than just reading a book and then walking away from it.

It was the jungle whitefolks planted in them. And it grew. It spread. In, through and after life, it spread, until it invaded the whites who had made it. Touched them every one.
