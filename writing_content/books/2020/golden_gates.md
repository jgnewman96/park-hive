Golden Gates by Conor Daugherty tells a meandering story of housing in the Bay Area. It combines individual stories focused on specific actors with a larger look at housing policy. We hear about community activists, politicians and people being forced from their homes. It combines a larger argument about problems with housing with an in depth looking at how the housing crisis impacts individual people.

Reading The [Color of Law by Richard Rothstein]({{< ref  "/writing/books/2020/color_of_law"  >}}) gave me a sense of historical patterns and how the housing market has become so inequitable. Owning homes is how a lot of people accumulated wealth. Understanding these historical dynamics helps me see a larger picture of housing inequality. It is not that housing policy exacerbates inequality but it is a direct driver of inequality.

It is easy to lose sight of individual people when talking about policy in general. We can make theoretical arguments about why a certain policy is going to help more people in the long run. This book forces us to remember all of the individuals that are impacting by housing policy. It is not something abstract that is impacting someone in distant places. Housing policy impacts your neighbors.

Housing policy is in a really tricky place right not where it needs to balance both long term and short term fixes. It is easy to argue from a long term optimal perspective that rent control does not make sense. But there are people whose lives right now would be improved by having rent control. It is also easy to argue that building more housing is a necessity in the long term. But there are people who will be forced out of their homes right now. We need to balance both those long term solutions and the short term ones.

This book showcases the James Joyce quote  "in the particular is the universal". This books is focused on one particular area at one particular time. But by doing so it is able to tell a compelling story about housing and urban policy in general. It does not feel like what is being discussed is specific to the Bay Area. What we learn from this story about housing policy can be applied both to other fields and to the other geographies.

Personally, living in the Bay Area has felt like living in a dystopian society. A society where there are only two outcomes. Lots of wealth juxtaposed next to homelessness. I have not felt connected to the Bay Area in the same way that I did living in Chicago or in New York.

Mixed solutions can feel like a cop-out, especially in polarized times. And yet, over and over, in city after city, it’s always where people end up and what seems most likely to work.
