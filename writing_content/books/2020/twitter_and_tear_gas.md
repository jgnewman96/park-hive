*Twitter and Tear Gas* By Zeynep Tufekci is a pointedly insightful read. I had been planning to read it ever since she was interviewed on Stratechery. It felt like a really good time to read this book with the BLM protests going on across the world. *Twitter and Tear Gas* is part a history of modern protests, part a personal reflection and part a deep dive on the societal impacts of technology.

The biggest theme I took away is how something or someone's biggest strength is also it's biggest weakness. Tufekci shows how some of the most powerful parts about technology also are it's weakest. Technology allows people to organize protests very easily. But that ease of organization can make it harder for protests to have a lasting impact because they do not develop the necessary organizational skills. Just as the internet makes it harder for information to be censored, it makes it easier for people to be hit with information overload and not know who to trust. Tufekci does not make bold claims about technology being a panacea, but rather deftly highlights both helpful and harmful impacts it has had on protest movements.

I was particularly fascinated by the last chapter about how authoritarian governments are responding in the technology era. Tufekci's framing as censorship not just as blocking information but also drowning out information or making information hard to trust, is very helpful. It showed me that Trump is practicing censorship with all his calls of fake news. The focus on fake news has made it so people have no idea who to trust.

This chapter made me reflect on how building trust in the internet age is really difficult. It is something that happens gradually over time. We need organizations that work hard to build trust and that begins with not having ad driven business model. With an ad driven business model, a companies incentive is not aligned to develop trust. With ads as the primary source of revenue, you want to maximize eyeballs on your content, not viewers trust in your content.

A media organization paid solely by subscribers could provide a lot of value by  being a source that people can trust. The organization can take time to publish on things until they see the full picture. There is no incentive to be the first one to a story. They can say, hey nothing really new has happened this week, we do not have new content for you. We need media organizations or just organizations in general to be focused on building trust.

The other incredible thing to me about this book was how much I learned about technology broadly by studying technology in such a narrow way. Tufekci was specifically interested in how technology has impacted modern protests. She was not trying to make sweeping conclusions about technology in general. By studying such a narrow space, Tufekci was able to ask very specific questions. Asking specific questions allows us to actually answer them and get a better understanding. Asking and answering these narrow questions can give us insight into understanding larger ones.

> In the twenty-first century and in the networked public sphere, it is more useful to think of attention as a resource allocated and acquired on local, national, and transnational scales, and censorship as a broad term for denial of attention through multiple means, including, but not limited to, the traditional definition of censorship as an effort to actively block information from getting out.

> Network internalities are the benefits and collective capabilities attained during the process of forming durable networks which occur regardless of what the task is, or how trivial it may seem, as long as it poses challenges that must be overcome collectively and require decision making, building of trust, and delegation among a semidurable network of people who interact over time.
