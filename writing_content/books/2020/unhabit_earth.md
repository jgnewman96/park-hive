Reading __Uninhabitable Earth__ by David Wallace-Wells really lit a fire under me with regard to climate change. Climate Change is something that does not impact my day to day and so it can be easy to not be thinking about it. It is not top of my mind when I am wasting energy or thinking about flying to visit a friend.

The beginning of the book is extremely powerful. It has a number of different chapters all devoted to the different ways climate change is harming our planet. One chapter looks at sea level rise, another at wildfires and another at pollution. Reading through all these chapters in a row paints a powerful picture of how dramatic the impact of climate change will be on the world.

While I the beginning of the book was quite good, the second half felt less strong to me. Wallace-Wells gets into some pretty existential conversations and seems to have a less cohesive narrative. While I love a good existential conversation, it was tough to follow all of the different references he was making. I would have enjoyed a sharper a focus on how we have everything we need to combat climate change. We created this problem and we can also solve it. The problem is lack of political will and individual motivation.

After reading the book I really wanted some more concrete actions I could be taking. Lucky me I had a tab sitting open since almost the beginning of the year that had just that information. It is a [long read](https://erikareinhardt.com/personal-climate-action) but Erika Reinhardt has collected so much information about personal climate action. She highlights lots of different actions we can take to help the environment.

Here are a couple of things I did after reading through her resources
- I signed up for recurring donations to [Wren](https://projectwren.com/profile/judahnewman?utm_campaign=share) to offset my carbon footprint. While I know offsetting my carbon footprint is very different from reducing it, doing so is still a worthwhile endeavor. This is no way absolves me of my carbon footprint and I should put more work into reducing my carbon footprint.
- I know that flying is particularly bad for the environment. I am going to make donations to [Compensaid](https://compensaid.com/) or the [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/) whenever I fly.
- I connected my utility bill to [Arcadia](https://www.arcadia.com/)
- I took all of my investments and switched them into green energy. Here are the index funds I am invested in.
    - [ICLN](ishares.com/us/products/239738/ishares-global-clean-energy-etf)
    - [TAN](https://www.etf.com/TAN)
    - [SMOG](https://www.etf.com/SMOG#overview)
    - [PBW](https://www.etf.com/PBW#overview)
- Erika also mentions a lot of different organizations in her article. Here are a couple of the ones I found to be the most intriguing
    - [Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/)
    - [Citizens Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/)
    - [Clean Air Task Force](https://www.catf.us/)
    - [Environmental Voter Project](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/)
    - [The Years Project](https://theyearsproject.com/)

But time is perhaps the most mind-bending feature, the worst outcomes arriving so long from now that we reflexively discount their reality.

It took New York City forty-five years to build three new stops on a single subway line; the threat of catastrophic climate change means we need to entirely rebuild the worldâ€™s infrastructure in considerably less time.
