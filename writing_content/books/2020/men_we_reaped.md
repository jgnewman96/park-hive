__Men We Reaped__ By Jesmyn Ward is an incredibly powerful and moving book. Ward tells a story of growing up in Mississippi and the impact it had on her community. The story looks specifically at the death of five men who were quite close to her. She tells the story from both sides. She has chapters that start at the present and work there ways backwards and chapters that start at her birth and work forwards. These chapter meet in the middle with the death of her brother.

While these stories are from the perspective of one women and her community, they paint a picture of racial inequality in the United States. The stories show the pressures that the United States puts on African American communities and how those pressures lead to bad outcomes.

Ward does such a good job of capturing feelings and emotions. When she is writing she evokes such strong imagery. I can connect with the emotions she is describing quite naturally.

I wonder why silence is the sound of our subsumed rage, our accumulated grief. I decide this is not right, that I must give voice to this story.

I was too immature to imagine at the time that the darkness that I carried from my prepubescent years, that conviction of worthlessness and self-loathing, could have touched others in my community.

{{< quote >}}
grief doesnâ€™t fade. Grief scabs over like my scars and pulls into new, painful configurations as it knits. It hurts in new ways. We are never free from grief. We are never free from the feeling that we have failed. We are never free from self-loathing. We are never free from the feeling that something is wrong with us, not with the world that made this mess.
