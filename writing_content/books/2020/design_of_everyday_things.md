**Where I found  it**: I have seen this book recommended in many different places. It has been on my list for a while.

**Why I wanted to read it**: As part of my job I have been thinking about design and how to build good products a lot this year. I thought it would be interesting to read one of the foundational books of design.

The __Design of Everyday Things__ does an incredible job motivating why design is important. Through the use of examples Norman show cases the impact of good design. I really appreciate how Norman uses examples. The examples he uses are very easily relatable. Everyone has the ability to think about how they interact with water faucets or door handles. By using such relatable examples Norman makes the book quite accessible.

Overall, I did not find so much in this book that would actually make me a better engineer or designer. There are a couple of useful frameworks that Norman introduces but I am not sure any of them have the staying power for them to be something that I will use. One of the biggest arguments that Norman makes though, is about the importance of communication. Whether it is written communication, spoken communication or just implicit communication, good design is all about communication. The product must communicate to the user how it should be used. When this is done really well, the user just inherently gets it.

One of the biggest arguments Norman makes is that we should never blame users. When products or systems fail it is always on the designer. I wonder if we can extend this even further. Could we extend this principle to people who commit crime? COuld we make the argument that it is not actually the fault of the user when they commit a crime but the fault of the system? I imagine people are much more receptive to Norman;s arguments then that one but in my head there are a lot of parallels between the two.

Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself.

Good conceptual models are the key to understandable, enjoyable products: good communication is the key to good conceptual models.

Because we are only aware of the reflective level of conscious processing, we tend to believe that all human thought is conscious. But it isnâ€™t. We also tend to believe that thought can be separated from emotion. This is also false.

{{< quote >}}
People are flexible, versatile, and creative. Machines are rigid, precise, and relatively fixed in their operations. There is a mismatch between the two, one that can lead to enhanced capability if used properly.

There is no such thing as the average person. This poses a particular problem for the designer, who usually must come up with a single design for everyone.
