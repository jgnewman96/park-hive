*Trick Mirror* by Jia Tolentino is a series of essays exploring identity and  the self in our current era. Tolentino blends personal stories and self reflections with larger dissections of structural systems in our society. I found Tolentino's writing incredibly compelling. She does not prescribe absolutes and allows nuance to shine through. She does not prescribe exact solutions but rather examines structures in our society and how she navigates them.

Tolentino's essays focused on how large structures pressure and impacts individuals in different situations. Whether it is the internet, reality tv, or weddings, Tolentino was continually struggling with how to be an individual in these large powerful systems. In each essay Tolentino explores how much impact can an individual have when they are part of these societal wide structures. Is an individual able to make a difference or are some issues a result of larger structures? How can we keep moving forward when it feels like our individual efforts do not make a difference?

One example of this difficulty between individual action and larger structural incentives is the internet. Tolentino argues that the internet is inherently structured to manipulate and takes advantage of us. But is opting out of the internet really an option. Is it even possible that we could turn the internet into something that we want it to be? If the the base incentives of life on the internet are misaligned with our visions and hopes, can we even make a difference as an individual? How do we think about collective action?

The other theme that stuck out to me across the essays were Tolentino's thoughts on the continuity of identity. She covers growing up in Texas, going to college, being in the peace corp, going to graduate school in Michigan and living in New York as a writer. Even though Tolentino's life goes in many different ways, she highlights a continuity of self. This continuity is most apparent in her essay about reality TV. She reflects on her time as a contest on a reality tv show and how she sees a lot of her current self in that character.

When I think about different periods of my life, the majority of my focus is on differences. I reflect on differences in my social interactions and what tasks were occupying my time. It was interesting to see Tolentino focus on how she has stayed the same in a lot of ways. She has clearly changed a lot as well, but in creating a cohesive narrative her focus seemed to be on those similarities. I would be curious to read more from her about how she has changed. It might also be instructive for me to reflect on ways past me is similar to current me.

I thought Tolentino shined the most as a writer when she let her personality come through. Some of the essays were more focused on who she was and some were more historical or analytical pieces. The best essays where when she was able to combine both of these together.

## Quotes

>  The last few years have taught me to suspend my desire for a conclusion, to assume that nothing is static and that renegotiation will be perpetual, to hope primarily that little truths will keep emerging in time

<!-- -->

> It’s as if our culture has mustered an immune-system response to continue breaking the fever of gender equality—as if some deep patriarchal logic has made it that women need to achieve ever-higher levels of beauty to make up for the fact that we are no longer economically and legally dependent on men.

> A more expansive idea of beauty is a good thing—I have appreciated it personally—and yet it depends on the precept, formalized by a culture where ordinary faces are routinely photographed for quantified approval, that beauty is still of paramount importance.

> the idea that personal advancement is a subversive form of political progress has been accepted as gospel. The trickiest thing about this idea is that it is incomplete and insufficient without being entirely wrong.

> the values of celebrity—visibility, performance, aspiration, extreme physical beauty—promote an approach to womanhood that relies on individual exceptionalism in an inherently conservative way
