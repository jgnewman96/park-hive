Reading *Catch and Kill* by Ronan Farrow was a real eye opener for me. I knew who Harvey Weinstein was but I did not know any of the details. A lot of the events covered in the book happened while I was in college when I did not  really follow the news.

My largest takeaway was that while the book might be centered on Harvey Weinstein, it is actually about so much more than any individual man. It is about our society as a whole, the power structures that we have in place and what kind of behavior we tolerate / support. These problems are not about a few individual bad actors. It is about the systematic structures that we have built.

It is easy to look down on perpetrators of sexual assault and treat them as outliers. It is easy to say these are bad people and they were going to be bad people no matter what. It is a lot more difficult to ask why are they perpetrators of sexual assault? What is it about our society that leads to people behaving in this manner? *Catch and Kill* showed that it was not just Harvey Weinstein. Almost every man in a position of power in the media industry had some encounter with sexual assault.

Over the past decade we have become more aware of how common sexual assault is. Sexual assault is still much more common then we understand. Farrow documents how hard it is for victims of sexual assault to talk about their experience. Many of these allegations get swept under the rug with non-disclosure agreements and large sums of money. We need to ask larger questions about our society if we want things to change. It is enough to put a persecute a small portion of the men who are accused of rape.

We need to understand why men in society feel entitled to women's bodies. We should better explore how men express themselves and why it often comes out in violent and angry ways. We should be asking questions about money and power. How do people internalize power dynamics and let that guide their actions? Money is just another form of power. Inequality in wealth is helping some while hurting others. All of these questions are tied together.

> “You know, the press is as much part of our democracy as Congress or the executive branch or the judicial branch. It has to keep things in check. And when the powerful control the press, or make the press useless, if the people can’t trust the press, the people lose. And the powerful can do what they want.”
