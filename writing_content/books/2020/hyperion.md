*Hyperion* by Dan Simmons is likely to join the group of sci-fi series where I read the first novel in the series and then do not read the others. This in no way means that I did not enjoy the book, but I find the first book in sci-fi series to be the most compelling. The world building and the introduction of characters is so gripping. There are so many books out there that I am compelled to read and so I often do not continue with the series.

While Hyperion was structured as one novel, it was really a set of short stories that maintained some continity and took place in the same world. Each story had its own style and its own narrator. Structuing a novel in this way allowed for many different narrators to express opinions about the same topic. Each story had a relation to the Shrike. The stories were so in depth and stand alone that it wasy easy to forgot they existed inside a larger story.
