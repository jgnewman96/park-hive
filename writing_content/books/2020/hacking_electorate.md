*Hacking the Electorate* By Eitan Hersh is an depth look at what information is accessible to campaigns and how they use that information to interact with voters. Hersh contextualizes his work by highlighting that he is focusing on the perspective of a campaign. A lot of previous research is through the lense perspective of voters. Hersh's main argument is that by looking through the perspective of campaigns we can understand how campaigns perceive voters. This view gives allows us to form hypothesize about what actions campaigns are going to take.

*Hacking the Electorate* is clearly written by an academic. It reads almost like an academic paper, albeit an extremely long one. This writing style made the book slow at certain times but it really drives Hersh's points home. There is a lot of repetition of the essential points.

To oversimplify the book into one paragraph, here is Hersh's argument. Campaigns only have limited information about individuals which comes from public voting records. These records contain information about every individual that has voted. In some states they contain information about the ethnicity of voters or which party voters are affiliated with. The contents of this information impacts how campaigns perceive voters. Campaigns perceptions influence their interactions with voters which in turn affects who participates in elections. One example of this is that some states collect party registration information. In these states campaigns know which voters are the same party as them. Campaigns who know potential voters' parties will spend more time trying to increase turnout of than anything else. This leads to campaigns interacting with people who are the same party as them rather than the general electorate.

While the book is a bit of a dry read, Hersh does a good job making compelling arguments. For each argument he highlights some reasons why it might be wrong and then attempts to rebuke them. In some instances he is very successful in this and others less so. I found the chapter about party identification and how that drives campaigns to be very convincing. The chapter about how racial identification drives actions was less convincing. There are some common traits about the states that keep ethnicity information about voters which could be driving differences. All of the states that record race are southern states. Hersh does not thoroughly address why these states keep race information and how keeping race information might be correlated with other factors.

At the end of the book, Hersh discuses the consequences of his research. He points out some undesirable characteristics of the current paradigm and changes that could be made. I really appreciate his idea about allowing voters to see what information is stored about them and to edit it if necessary.

It is easy to read this book and trend towards an extreme. Politicians are using data collection to help them target certain voters. This information allows politicians to target different voters with different messages. There is no longer a cohesive vision of who a politician is when they are different to different voters. When voters have different perceptions of politicians due to imbalances of information, that can led to fracturing and polarization. A possible conclusion from this line of thinking might be to ban microtargeting and certain types of data collection. banning I believe that trying to stop these technologies, while coming from a good place, is a misguided direction. These technologies are already ingrained in our society. While there are negative consequences of them there are also positive ones.

Rather than a discussion about *whether* we want these technologies, we should be think about *how* we want these technologies to be used. I love Hersh's push for more transparency about data collection. Let's both increase transparency but also increase individual control. Voters should know what information is being stored about them, who is accessing it and how it is being used. Voters should have to give consent before their information is used. When their information is used they should know what was accessed and what was done with it.

We should also push for this technology to make better governing rather than more targeted campaigning. We should use voter information to give citizens more resources about public services. We can create better targeted social services. Rather than outlawing the technology as bad because of how it is currently being used, we need to imagine a world where it is being used in a way that upholds the values we cherish.

> their efforts will only take them so far; as long as the root population data come from public records, campaigns will only be able to stretch these data so far in forming predictions of attributes like the propensity to be uninformed about political issues

> Ordinary voters ought to be able to at least access and perhaps comment on the profiles that political campaigns, parties, and associated companies build about them. In the end, opening up databases to voters might be in the interest of political campaigns and parties as well, not just of voters.
