*Braiding Sweet Grass* is a set of short stories about nature from Robin Kimmerer's life. Kimmerer blends a scientific perspective with a perspective from from her heritage as a Native American. While each story is about an individual relationship between humans and nature, she often makes larger points about how human view themselves in the world. Kimmerer questions human's claim of intelligent supremacy, challenges some of our economic systems and laments different ways our society is narrow minded.

Kimmerer's stories force us to be humble. Science is discovering everything that we do not know. It is a process of recognizing how limited are inherent perspective. Every time we learn something, we learn five more things we do not know. Kimmerer constantly displays extremely intelligent and adaptive systems in nature. She shows the complexities different plants interacting with each other or how eco systems maintain themselves. We are forced to reckon with how little we understand about nature and how natural systems have evolved truly remarkable capabilities.

I was forced to reflect on my relationship with nature. Kimmerer's repeatedly return to the necessity of humans cultivating a symbiotic relationship with nature. Humans should not assume the best they can is leaving nature alone. Humans must have an active relationship with nature. When humans and nature act together is what allows both to flourish.

## Quotes

> Science pretends to be purely rational, completely neutral, a system of knowledge-making in which the observation is independent of the observer. And yet the conclusion was drawn that plants cannot communicate because they lack the mechanisms that animals use to speak.

> The more something is shared, the greater its value becomes. This is hard to grasp for societies steeped in notions of private property, where others are, by definition, excluded from sharing.

<!-- -->

> Might science and traditional knowledge be purple and yellow to one another, might they be goldenrod and asters? We see the world more fully when we use both.

> The job is never over; it simply changes from one task to the next. What I’m looking for, I suppose, is balance, and that is a moving target. Balance is not a passive resting place—it takes work, balancing the giving and the taking, the raking out and the putting in.

> say “I discovered X.” That’s kind of like Columbus claiming to have discovered America. It was here all along, it’s just that he didn’t know it. Experiments are not about discovery but about listening and translating the knowledge of other beings.

> Restoration offers concrete means by which humans can once again enter into positive, creative relationship with the more-than-human world, meeting responsibilities that are simultaneously material and spiritual. It’s not enough to grieve. It’s not enough to just stop doing bad things.
