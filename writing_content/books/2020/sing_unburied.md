*Sing, Unburied Sing* is a novel by Jesmyn Ward set in the American South. As with Ward's other books, the novel does such an incredible job of getting inside characters heads. Ward is able to convey characters as nuanced individuals. She shows the darkest parts of our internal minds, how complex and convoluted they can be.

*Sing, Unburied Sing* feels like it is building towards something for the first half of the book. The reader does not know where we are going, but it feels like we have to be building towards something. There are two scenes which serve as climaxes for the novel. They are both quite moving. During the first half of the book I was kind of lost. Ward would often introduce something or someone without fully explaining them. The reader would only get the information later on through bits and pieces. The climactic scenes hit me differently and with more power because of the lead up to them.

One of my favorite parts about Ward's writing is that it never feels like she is leading you to a specified destination. Many books feel like they are written with a specific lesson in mind. After reading the book we are supposed to have learned something. Ward's approach seems to be quite different. Rather than write to a message, she attempts to write characters that are as truthful as possible. Characters that are messy and distraught. Characters that are still learning more about themselves and about the world.

A less skillful writer would have made Leonie the villain of this novel. Leonie is quite often mean and neglectful of her children. She does things that hurt her parents and make their lives more difficult. It is especially easy to have a negative opinion of her because of the chapters from JoJo's perspective. Ward is able to capture Leonie's feelings of want and desire so well. I was overcome by the strength of Leonie's desire for escape. It is not as simple as looking down on Leonie because she can be neglectful.

While the book was only from the perspective of Leonie, JoJo and Richie, River and Michael are the real driving forces behind the novel. For all three of the characters, there was such intense desire to connect with either River or Michael. There were a number of passages describing how Leonie responded to Michael's presence. We also heard about how Jojo and Richie both wanted to connect with Pop. The novel presents an intriguing look at how different characters can serve different roles based on whose perspective the book is written from.
