*American Marriage* by Tayari Jones is an absolutely gripping novel about a couple where the husband goes to jail for a crime he did not commit. The novel is written from the perspective of three different characters in long form first person monologues. I have not read a book in a while that was as gripping as *American Marriage*. There is something so powerful about first person internal monologues. The book is paced in a way that things are constantly turning and changing in different directions. The reader is constantly on the edge of their seat about what is going to happen next.

Normally, when I read a book there are certain characters I really resonate with and that I am rooting for. One of the most powerful things about *American Marriage* is how each character has a point of view that resonated with me. I was not clearly rooting for any of the characters. They all felt like real people that were selfish and difficult at times. I could relate to the different emotions they were feeling. This was not a hero versus villain narrative.

While I was reading the book, it was so easy to get caught up in the characters emotions and relationships that I forgot there was a real villain in this story. The villain is the American justice system and how it tears people apart. The criminal justice system tears families apart and disproportional affects people of color.
