__Transcendent Kingdom__ is Yaa Gyasi's second novel. I really enjoyed reading Homegoing a couple of years ago which made me excited to pick up this novel. The novel is told from the perspective of Gifty a neuroscience PHD student who grew up in Alabama. Gifty's mom emigrated from Ghana with her husband shortly after Gifty's older brother was born. The novel tells the story of Gifty's life by intermingling stories from the past with the present.

Gifty's history and experience have such a large impact on who she is today. We are able to understand Gifty's actions in the present more as we uncover more about her past. By intermingling the present and the past consistently we are forced to connect these two together and understand them as one picture.

The novel is very interested in the relationship between science and religion. Gifty grew up in a very religious household attending church regularly. Trying to understand God and her relationship to God is a question that comes up over and over again for Gifty in her childhood. Through the book we see how Gifty slowly moves away from some parts of the Church. We also see that a lot of the things that attracted Gifty to religion are also what attract her to science. She is looking for answers to similar questions. It can be easy for us to view science and religion as opposites that attract different types of people. This novel forces us to consider that the reasons someone might be attracted to science are the same reasons someone is attracted to religion.

As I was reading this story, I was thinking about the role of mystery in good story telling. I recently watched the movie **Knives Out** which is a classic murder mystery. With a story like that, so much of the motivation is trying to understand the full picture. But even for stories that are not murder mysteries the uncovering of mystery is a really important part of good story telling. Good story telling makes it so that we want to learn more. We want to understand more about these people or this situation and that is what compels us to continue on with the story. If we did not want to learn more then we would not continue reading. While a murder mystery story might do this in a very opaque way, it was interesting for me to inspect how this story only revealed certain information to us at certain times.

When I am reading a story, I am often trying to understand what motivated the author to write this story. What part of this story is the author most interested in or what ideas compelled them to put the time into telling this story. With __Transcendent Kingdom__ I would love to hear more about why Gyasi told this story. One big motivator could have been looking more deeply at science and religion. This story is also one of immigration and the pressures that puts on people. It also looks at struggling financially and the pressures that puts on people. This is also a story of trauma and how our history impacts us. In all likelihood for Gyasi these are not individual distinct threads. They are inherently tied together.

I am angry that she doesn’t understand me, doesn’t see me as my own, separate person, but that anger stems from the fact that I don’t see her that way either.

{{< quote >}}
Yet a man who uses an imaginary map, thinking that it is a true one, is likely to be worse off than someone with no map at all; for he will fail to inquire whenever he can, to observe every detail on his way, and to search continuously with all his senses and all his intelligence for indications of where he should go.
