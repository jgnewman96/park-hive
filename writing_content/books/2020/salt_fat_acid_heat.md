This book was such a good read, I loved learning the fundamentals of cooking. Most other recipe books give you a bunch of recipes but never explain why something tastes good or why flavors go together. I have been drifting towards this approach to cooking for a while now. I was trying not to follow recipes, but instead use recipes as inspiration. It never felt like following a recipe exactly by the book was sustainable.

This book contains so much quality information that I know i will need to return to it multiple times. I  actually did not read any of the recipes because I was reading on my kindle and hag gotten the book from the library. Owning cookbooks during this point in my life seems cumbersome but I am excited to own this book in the future.

It is interesting reading this book being a vegetarian because so much of it does not relate to my cooking. A lot of the book focuses on how to prepare meat. One of my favorite parts of being a vegetarian is that it forces me to cook a lot more. When you are a vegetarian going out to restaurants often means you are a second class citizen. Most restaurants mains dishes are aimed toward meat eaters. When I go to a restaurant I often feel like I am missing out. When I cook for myself though, I never feel like I am missing anything.

This book could also be summed up in the feeling way: USE YOUR SENSES. The philosophy put forward in the book is to be constantly be tasting and looking at your food. Do not trust some directions someone else wrote. Observe what is going on right in front of you and respond to it. Have a picture in your mind of what your final product looks like and then work from there.

I really liked her approach to cooking. Start by creating a vision of your final product. Then take one step back, what needs to happen one step before that final product. Keep taking steps backward until you get to the start. Now you have a recipe! This approach could be applied to many other processes besides cooking.
