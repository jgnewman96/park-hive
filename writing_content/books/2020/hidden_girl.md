__The Hidden Girl and Other Stories__ by Ken Liu us a book of short science fiction stories. There is one set of stories that is a trilogy but otherwise each story is a standalone.

There were a lot of stories in this collection and I found most of them to be a little underwhelming. There was one story though that I thought was very powerful. The story was about charitable giving and how we think about our own impacts on the world. The story ends up being an argument between two college roommates. One who prefers a much more decentralized world and one who prefers a centralized world. There back and forth was incredibly powerful. I would recommend reading __Byzantine Empathy__ but skip the rest of the book.

But there’s a greater truth she doesn’t see. Just because something happened doesn’t make it a decisive fact; just because there’s suffering doesn’t mean there is always a better choice; just because people die doesn’t mean we must abandon greater principles. The world isn’t always black and white.

“Emotion has always been at the core of what it means to do right, not merely a tool for persuasion. Are you opposed to slavery because you have engaged in a rational analysis of the costs and benefits of the institution? No, it’s because you’re revolted by it. You empathize with the victims

“Call a woman a financial engineer or a man an agricultural systems analyst, and the world thinks they know something about them,” she wrote. “But what does the job a person has been channeled into have to do with who they are?”

I don’t point out that this smacks to me of a false dichotomy: Human versus Nature. I don’t bring up the sunken continents, the erupting volcanoes, the peaks and valleys in the earth’s climate over billions of years, the advancing and retreating ice caps, and the uncountable species that have come and gone. Why do we hold up this one moment as natural, to be prized above all others?
