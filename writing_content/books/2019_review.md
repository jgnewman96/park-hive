As another year passes I reflect on what I did over the past year and what I learned. Looking back it is tempting to focus on what has changed over the past year. It is tempting to compare where I am now and where I was a year ago. I have moved to a new city and started a new job. But comparing one year to another is so divorced from the actual experience of a year. Switching jobs was something that happened gradually over time. Moving cities was also a process that happened gradually over time. While there is a sharp discontinuity around each of these events, they were both actually long processes.

The best way for me to accurately sum up my year is too look back at the books I read. Doing this helps me remember what I was thinking about and what I learned. It allows me to see that my thinking trends in certain directions. That there are thoughts I return to. It gives me reference material that I can refer back to about a period of time in my life.

When I did this in 2018, I looked back through all my highlights and found the quotes that were the most meaningful. For 2019, it was mostly the same process. Once, I started this website though, I started writing about each book after I finished it and keeping track of the quotes. For the books I read towards the end of the year, you will see a link rather than the quotes directly below.

Having gone through this process, there are a couple of themes in my thinking that stick out.

* * *

There were a couple of different topics I read about a lot. During the summer I read a fair amount about health. Through out the year I read quite a bit about race and how race impacts society. I also read a number of books about the environment and climate change. These are three different subjects that interest me a lot and I am excited to continue learning more about them.

The largest theme that seemed to purvey all that I read, is how everything is more complicated then we make it out to be. We are constantly trying to simplify and categorize things. The amount of randomness and information out there is so large, that we have to simplify it to get any understanding. It is in human nature to view things as binary rather than on a spectrum. We seek out clear boundaries rather than fuzziness. Telling attractive narratives  and not seeing randomness. It is a constant fight against our own nature to see the truth and not give in to oversimplifications.

We can objectively know all of this and still be susceptible to it. I have personally struggled a lot this year with the idea that I am insignificant. There is nothing special about me and that I am just one being. I find myself constantly yearning to be special, to be different. I have also been thinking about this on the macro level of the human race. What makes humans any more special than any other creature? We have defined our existence as being more important. But are our definitions correct? Would a different species not make different definitions?

Working through this question through out the year I have come to a place of some acceptance. While it will be something I continue to work through for a lifetime, I have come to a place that makes some sense to me. I am not special because of my skill at anything. I am not special because I am smart or because I particularly excel at anything. I am special because of my own personal history and existence. No other person has the same history or experience as me. I am a unique individual that brings a different history and different perspective than anyone else. This is what makes me special. But it is also what makes all individuals special.

Previously, being special has meant differentiating myself from others. I am special if there is something that I am that other individuals are not. For me to be special, other people must be normal. But this new meaning of being special does not require that distinction. It does not compare me to others. It understands that everyone is special. I am not special because I am in someway differentiated from others but rather recognizes the inherent uniqueness of an individual experience.


#### *The Three Body Problem - Liu Cixin*

> It’s important to take the time out of our busy schedules to do something entirely unrelated to our immediate needs. This project has allowed us to give some thought to issues we have never had time for

<!-- -->

> The long years had ground away all the hardness and fierceness in their personalities, until all that was left was a gentleness like that of water


#### *The Autobiography of Malcom X - Malcolm X, Alex Haley*

 > But people are always speculating—why am I as I am? To understand that of any person, his whole life, from birth, must be reviewed. All of our experiences fuse into our personality. Everything that ever happened to us is an ingredient.

<!-- -->

> Behind bars, a man never reforms. He will never forget. He never will get completely over the memory of the bars.

<!-- -->

> “Don’t condemn if you see a person has a dirty glass of water,” he said, “just show them the clean glass of water that you have. When they inspect it, you won’t have to say that yours is better.”

<!-- -->

> The Holy Bible in the white man’s hands and his interpretations of it have been the greatest single ideological weapon for enslaving millions of non-white human beings.

<!-- -->

> “I’m man enough to tell you that I can’t put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I’m flexible.”

#### *Salvage The Bones - Jesmyn Ward*

> there is a great split between now and then, and I wonder where the world where that day happened has gone,
because we are not in it.

#### *Zone One - Colson Whitehead*

> New York City in death was very much like New York City in life. It was still hard to get a cab, for example.

<!-- -->

> We never see other people anyway, only the monsters we make of them

#### *The New Geography of Jobs - Enrico Moretti*

> The focus on short-term events often results in information that is incomplete, irrelevant, or both

<!-- -->

> But trade is not a zero-sum game like a football match, where if your opponent wins you lose. The reality is that if one of our trading partners becomes more productive, the goods we are buying from that country become cheaper. This makes us—the consumers—a little richer.

<!-- -->

> Because of the self-sustaining nature of economic development, cities that are similar initially can become very different over time as small differences become magnified.

<!-- -->

> It is in our own interest to subsidize other people’s education, as it ends up indirectly benefiting us.

<!-- -->

> Location is more important than ever, in part because knowledge spillovers are more important than ever. This is a key reason for the accelerating divergence in the fortunes of the three Americas.

#### *The Parable of the Sower - Octavia Butler*

> CIVILIZATION IS TO GROUPS what intelligence is to individuals. It is a means of combining the intelligence of many to achieve ongoing group adaptation. Civilization, like intelligence, may serve well, serve adequately, or fail to serve its adaptive function. When civilization fails to serve, it must disintegrate unless it is acted upon by unifying internal or external forces.

<!-- -->

> But things have changed a lot, and they’ll change more. Things are always changing. This is just one of the big jumps instead of the little step-by-step changes that are easier to take.

#### *The Black Swan - Nicholas Nassim Taleb*

> What is surprising is not the magnitude of our forecast errors, but our absence of awareness of it.

<!-- -->

> I developed the governing impression that our minds are wonderful explanation machines, capable of making sense out of almost anything, capable of mounting explanations for all manner of phenomena, and generally incapable of accepting the idea of unpredictability.

<!-- -->

> Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity.

<!-- -->

> Our minds are like inmates, captive to our biology, unless we manage a cunning escape

<!-- -->

> Remember that we treat ideas like possessions, and it will be hard for us to part with them

<!-- -->
#### *The Orphan Master's Son - Adam Johnson*

> Then sleep, communal, a hundred boys bunked four tiers deep, all their common exhaustion articulated as a singularity. It was nothing short of belonging, a feeling that wasn’t particularly profound or intense, it was just the best he tended to get

<!-- -->

> how difficult it was to come to see the lies you told yourself, the ones that allowed you to function and move forward. To really do it, you needed someone’s help

<!-- -->

#### *Breakfast of Champions - Kurt Vonnegut*
> They were doing their best to live like people invented in story books. This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.

<!-- -->

> I resolved to shun storytelling. I would write about life. Every person would be exactly as important as any other. All facts would also be given equal weightiness. Nothing would be left out. Let others bring order to chaos. I would bring chaos to order, instead, which I think I have done.

#### *Think Like a Commoner - David Bollier*
> The traditional advocates of reform, liberals and social democrats, while generally concerned with market abuses and government malfeasance, are themselves too exhausted to imagine new paths forward

<!-- -->

> Put another way, a commons is a resource + a community + a set of social protocols. The three are an integrated, interdependent whole.

<!-- -->

> If we are to understand the law of the commons, we must start by expanding our notion of law itself. Law is not just formal, written and institutional; it is also informal, oral and social.

<!-- -->

> The price system typically fails to take account of all sorts of value that are external to the marketplace.

<!-- -->

> On the other hand, a certain redundancy and inefficiency are essential to a system’s long-term resilience

#### *I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings - Maya Angelou*

> I find it interesting that the meanest life, the poorest existence, is attributed to God's will, but as human beings become more affluent, as their living standard and style begin to ascend the material scale, God descends the scale of responsibility at a commensurate

<!-- -->

> Never heard the words, despite the thousands of times I had sung them. Never thought they had anything to do with me.

<!-- -->

> To be left alone on the tightrope of youthful unknowing is to experience the excruciating beauty of full freedom and the threat of eternal indecision. Few, if any, survive their teens. Most surrender to the vague but murderous pressure of adult conformity. It becomes easier to die and avoid conflicts than to maintain a constant battle with the superior forces of maturity

#### *The Dispossessed - Ursula K. Le Guin*

> Like all walls it was ambiguous, two-faced. What was inside it and what was outside it depended upon which side of it you were on

<!-- -->

> No matter how intelligent a man is, he can’t see what he doesn’t know how to see

<!-- -->

> To make a thief, make an owner; to create crime, create laws

<!-- -->

> They say there is nothing new under any sun. But if each life is not new, each single life, then why are we born?

<!-- -->

#### *The Dog of the South - Charles Portis*



#### *Born a Crime - Trevor Noah*

> In America the dream is to make it out of the ghetto. In Soweto, because there was no leaving the ghetto, the dream was to transform the ghetto.

<!-- -->

> I believed that Fufi was my dog, but of course that wasn’t true. Fufi was a dog. I was a boy. We got along well. She happened to live in my house. That experience shaped what I’ve felt about relationships for the rest of my life: You do not own the thing that you love.

#### *Less - Andrew Sean Greer*

> That the mind cannot be trusted is a certainty

<!-- -->

>  It’s that they’ve survived everything in life, humiliations and disappointments and heartaches and missed opportunities, bad dads and bad jobs and bad sex and bad drugs, all the trips and mistakes and face-plants of life, to have made it to fifty and to have made it here

#### *Homegoing - Yaa Gyasi*

> Strength is knowing that everyone belongs to themselves

<!-- -->

> A poet’s got to spend more time livin’ than he does studyin

<!-- -->

> So when you study history, you must always ask yourself, Whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice could come forth?

<!-- -->

> Sonny had never loved her, not really. But he had always wanted her. It took him a while to learn the difference between those two things.


#### *The Overstory - Richard Powers*

> A kind of awareness—something so different from human intelligence that intelligence thinks it’s nothing

<!-- -->

> The psyche’s job is to keep us blissfully ignorant of who we are, what we think, and how we’ll behave in any situation. We’re all operating in a dense fog of mutual reinforcement. Our thoughts are shaped primarily by legacy hardware that evolved to assume that everyone else must be right. But even when the fog is pointed out, we’re no better at navigating through it

<!-- -->

> To be human is to confuse a satisfying story with a meaningful one, and to mistake life for something huge with two legs

#### *The Book of Why - Judea Pearl*

> You cannot answer a question that you cannot ask, and you cannot ask a question that you have no words for

<!-- -->

> while probabilities encode our beliefs about a static world, causality tells us whether and how probabilities change when the world changes, be it by intervention or by act of imagination.

<!-- -->

> causal analysis requires the user to make a subjective commitment. She must draw a causal diagram that reflects her qualitative belief—or, better yet, the consensus belief of researchers in her field of expertise—

<!-- -->

> The questions I have just asked are all causal, and causal questions can never be answered from data alone. They require us to formulate a model of the process that generates the data, or at least some aspects of that process

#### *The Emperor of All Maladies - Siddhartha Mukherjee*

> Scientists often study the past as obsessively as historians because few other professions depend so acutely on it. Every experiment is a conversation with a prior experiment, every new theory a refutation of the old

<!-- -->

> “Basic research,” Bush wrote, “is performed without thought of practical ends. It results in general knowledge and an understanding of nature and its laws. This general knowledge provides the means of answering a large number of important practical problems, though it may not give a complete specific answer to any one of them.… “Basic research leads to new knowledge. It provides scientific capital. It creates the fund from which the practical applications of knowledge must be drawn.

<!-- -->

> “The death rates from malaria, cholera, typhus, tuberculosis, scurvy, pellagra and other scourges of the past have dwindled in the US because humankind has learned how to prevent these diseases.… To put most of the effort into treatment is to deny all precedent.”

<!-- -->

> Cancer’ is, in truth, a variety of diseases. Viewing it as a single disease that will yield to a single approach is no more logical than viewing neuropsychiatric disease as a single entity

#### *There There - Tommy Orange*

> You don’t have to defend all white people you think aren’t a part of the problem just because I said something negative about white culture

<!-- -->

> Everything here is formed in relation to every other living and nonliving thing from the earth….Nothing is original, everything comes from something that came before, which was once nothing

#### *The Breakthrough - Charles Graeber*

> Scientists are people; they have beliefs, and are personally invested in them. And that can sometimes lead to unintentional and often unconscious bias, and a sort of intellectual blindness. It can, in other words, make even scientists unscientific.

<!-- -->

> the goal isn’t necessarily beating cancer today; it’s staying alive long enough to take advantage of the next advances, the ones right around the corner.


#### *The Fire This Time - Jesmyn Warn*

> I believe there is power in words, power in asserting our existence, our experience, our lives, through words. That sharing our stories confirms our humanity. That it creates community, both within our own community and beyond it

<!-- -->

> What my English teachers didn’t say was that voices aren’t discovered fully formed, they are built and shaped—and not just by words, punctuation, and sentences, but by the author’s intended audience, by the composition’s form, and by subject


#### *Snow Crash - Neal Stephenson*
> the human mind can absorb and process an incredible amount of information—if it comes in the right format. The right interface. If you put the right face on it

<!-- -->

> Besides, interesting things happen along borders—transitions—not in the middle where everything is the same

<!-- -->

> Computers rely on the one and the zero to represent all things. This distinction between something and nothing—this pivotal separation between being and nonbeing—is quite fundamental and underlies many Creation myth

<!-- -->

> That was part of Enki’s plan. Monocultures, like a field of corn, are susceptible to infections, but genetically diverse cultures, like a prairie, are extremely robust

#### *Why We Sleep - Matthew Walker*

> A theory that cannot be discerned true or false in this way will always be abandoned by science, and that is precisely what happened to Freud and his psychoanalytic practices

<!-- -->

> This mentality has persisted, in part, because certain business leaders mistakenly believe that time on-task equates with task completion and productivity. Even in the industrial era of rote factory work, this was untrue. It is a misguided fallacy, and an expensive one, too


#### *Eileen - Otessa Moshfegh*

> I didn’t want anyone to think I was susceptible to bad breath, or that there were any organic processes occurring inside my body at all. Having to breathe was an embarrassment in itself. This was the kind of girl I was.

<!-- -->

> I had no idea that other people—men or women—felt things as deeply as I did. I had no compassion for anyone unless his suffering allowed me to indulge in my own

#### *Palaces for the People - Eric Klinberg*

> Social infrastructure is crucially important, because local, face-to-face interactions—at the school, the playground, and the corner diner—are the building blocks of all public life. People forge bonds in places that have healthy social infrastructures—not because they set out to build community, but because when people engage in sustained, recurrent interaction, particularly while doing things they enjoy, relationships inevitably grow

<!-- -->

> Social infrastructures that promote efficiency tend to discourage interaction and the formation of strong ties.

#### *The Brothers Karamazov - Fyodor Dostoyevsky*

> It’s still possible to love one’s neighbor abstractly, and even occasionally from a distance, but hardly ever up close.

<!-- -->

> Everything is habit with people, everything, even state and political relations. Habit is the chief motive force.

<!-- -->

> in life that when there are two opposites one must look for truth in the middle

<!-- -->

> There are souls that in their narrowness blame the whole world. But overwhelm such a soul with mercy, give it love, and it will curse what it has done, for there are so many germs of good

#### *We Were Eight Years in Power - Ta Nehisi-Coates*

> I knew, even then, that whenever I nodded along in ignorance, I lost an opportunity, betrayed the wonder in me by privileging the appearance of knowing over the work of finding out

<!-- -->

> The world might fall off a cliff, but I did not have to be among those pushing it and more, I did not have to nod along while fools insisted that gravity was debatable

<!-- -->

> It did not occur to me that writing is always some form of interpretation, some form of translating the specificity of one’s roots or expertise or even one’s own mind into language that can be absorbed and assimilated into the consciousness of a broader audience

<!-- -->

> Racism is not merely a simplistic hatred. It is, more often, broad sympathy toward some and broader skepticism toward others.

<!-- -->

> The idea of reparations threatens something much deeper—America’s heritage, history, and standing in the world

<!-- -->

> White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this—which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never—the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed
