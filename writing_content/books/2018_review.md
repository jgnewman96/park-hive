It is that time of year again when every website is publishing some piece of content trying to sum up 2018. Whether it is Facebook, posting a video that is your year in review, or a march madness style bracket to determine what person, place, or thing won 2018, everybody is attempting to summarize the past year.

A lot has happened over the past year. In 2018, I graduated college and started my first full time job. I moved to a new apartment. My brother got married and my two remaining grandparents died. I spent more time on an airplane then I had in any previous year. As always, the only constant is that things are changing.

One big change that happened in 2018 is that I read more this year than any other year previously. In total, I read 38 books over the past year. A large part in this increase was due to getting a Kindle for the holidays last year. Another big part was now that I have graduated, I have a lot more free time to be reading. There is no better way to sum up my 2018 then a review of the different books I read this year.

* * *

Here is the list of all the books I read this year. I also included some of the more meaningful quotes and ideas from certain books. Some of the books do not have quotes because they are graphic novels, some because they are hardcovers which I lent to other people and some because they are books from the library and so I cannot look back at my highlights.

Before we delve into the list though, here are some high level stats about the books I read.

I read 38 books by 34 different authors. 11 of those authors were female, 7 of the authors were black, and 7 of those authors were asian. 20 of the books were fiction while 18 of them were non-fiction. Of the 20 that were fiction, 11 of the books were science fiction (My brother’s tastes influence me, it would seem).

#### *The Opposite of Loneliness — Marina Keegan*

Thoughts on why so many people do consulting post-graduation:

> “What bothers me is this idea of validation, of rationalization. The notion that some of us (regardless of what we tell ourselves) are doing this because we’re not sure what else to do and it’s easy to apply to and it will pay us decently and it will make us feel like we’re still successful. I just haven’t met that many people who sound genuinely excited about these jobs. That’s super depressing! I don’t understand why no one is talking about it.”

#### *Ender’s Game and Ender’s Shadow — Orson Scott Card*

> “Human beings may be miserable specimens, in the main, but we can learn, and, through learning, become decent people.”

> “You, however, understand the profound truth that you must reveal your stupidity openly. To hold your stupidity inside you is to embrace it, to cling to it, to protect it …. But when you expose your stupidity, you give yourself the chance to have it caught, corrected, and replaced with wisdom”

#### *Between the World and Me — Ta-Nehisi Coates*

> “I have raised you to respect every human being as singular, and you must extend that same respect into the past. Slavery is not an indefinable mass of flesh. It is a particular, specific enslaved woman, whose mind is active as your own, whose range of feeling is as vast as your own; who prefers the way the light falls in one particular spot in the woods, who enjoys fishing where the water eddies in a nearby stream, who loves her mother in her own complicated way, thinks her sister talks too loud, has a favorite cousin, a favorite season, who excels at dressmaking and knows, inside herself, that she is as intelligent and capable as anyone.”

> “My work is to give you what I know of my own particular path while allowing you to walk your own”

#### *The Fire Next Time — James Baldwin*

> “This is because white Americans have supposed “Europe” and “civilization” to be synonyms — which they are not — and have been distrustful of other standards and other sources of vitality, especially those produced in America itself, and have attempted to behave in all matters as though what was east for Europe was also east for them.”

#### *Tinkers — Paul Harding*

> “He resented his resentment because it was a sign of his own limitations of spirit and humility”

#### *Slaughterhouse-Five — Kurt Vonnegut*

> “But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human”

#### *Kindred — Octavia Butler*

> “I realized that I knew less about loneliness than I had thought — and much less than I would know when he went away”

#### *The Wind’s Twelve Quarter’s & The Left Hand of Darkness — Ursula K. Le Guin*

> “To learn which questions are unanswerable, and not to answer them: this skill is most needful in times of stress and darkness”

> “No, I don’t mean love, when I say patriotism. I mean fear. The fear of the other. And its expressions are political, not poetical: hate, rivalry, aggression. It grows in us, that fear. It grows in us year by year”

#### *Annihilation, Authority & Acceptance — Jeff VanderMeer*

> “Because our minds process information almost solely through analogy and categorization, we are often defeated when presented with something that fits no category and lies outside of the realm of our analogies”

#### *Secular Buddhism — Stephan Batchelor*

#### *Pachinko — Min Jin Lee*

> “That to live without forgiveness was a kind of death with breathing and movement”

#### *Dreams from My Father — Barack Obama*

> “For me, it’s been a relatively quiet period, less a time of discovery than of consolidation, of doing the things that we tell ourselves we finally must do to grow up”

#### *The Alchemist — Paulo Coehlo*

> “The story of one person is the story of everyone”

#### *Hillbilly Elegy_ — J.D. Vance*

> “The best way to look at this might be to recognize that you probably can’t fix these things. They’ll always be around. But maybe you can put your thumb on the scale a little for the people at the margins.”

#### *Us vs. Them: The Failure of Globalism — Ian Bremmer*

> “Social media allows us to follow those we agree with and ignore those we don’t, enabling us to deprive ourselves of opportunities to deepen our thinking and change our minds”

#### *Bad Feminist — Roxanne Gay*

#### *Factfulness — Hans Rosling*

#### *The Best We Could Do — Thi Bui*

#### *Are You My Mother? — Allison Bechdel*

#### *The Remains of The Day — Kazuo Ishiguro*

#### *One Hundred Year’s of Solitude — Gabriel Garcia Marquez*

#### *The Forest Unseen_ — David George Haskell*

> “Our cultural and scientific memories of what a “normal” forest should look like arose at a peculiar moment in history”

> Likewise, our naming imposes tidy categories on nature. These may not reflect life’s complicated genealogies and reproductive exchanges.

> “The snails’ hermaphroditic embrace, seemingly so alien to most humans, is a reminder that sexuality in nature is more malleable and diverse than we might at first suppose”

#### *Artemis — Andy Weir*

#### *The Inevitable — Kevin Kelly*

> This circular expansion of both problems and solutions hides a steady accumulation of small net benefits over time.

> I think we’ll be surprised by how many of the things we assumed were “natural” for humans are not really natural at all.

> In other words, science is a method that chiefly expands our ignorance rather than our knowledge.

#### *When Breath Becomes Air — Paul Kalanthi*

#### *Little Fires Everywhere — Celeste Ng*

> “What made someone a mother? Was it biology alone, or was it love?”

#### *Radical Markets — Eric Posner & Glen Weyl*

> “Open markets embody the idea that by cooperating as broadly as possible, we can all benefit from each other”

> “But because no good mechanisms exist for making collective decisions, these aspects of life are often extremely frustrating, leading many people to avoid them when possible”

> “Failing to recognize data as labor could thus create what Lanier calls “fake unemployment,” where jobs dry up not because humans are not useful but because the valuable inputs they supply are treated as byproducts of entertainment rather than as socially valued work”

#### *What We Were Promised — Lucy Tan*

> “Why do our minds fixate on the kinds of love we’re not getting instead of the kinds of love we are? We expect it to be the thing we want it to be. And we’re blind to every other form of it.”

> “It frightened her, the ease with which she could arrive in a place without any obvious intention”

#### *White Tears — Hari Kunzru*

> “There is no clear border between life and non-life. Once you realize that, so much else unravels”

#### *The Fifth Season — N.K. Jemisin*

> “Survival doesn’t mean rightness”

> “It’s a gift if it makes us better. It’s a curse if we let it destroy us. You decide that — not the instructors, or the Guardians, or anyone else.”

#### *Surely Your Joking Mr Feynman — Richard Feynman*

> “You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It’s their mistake, not my failing”

#### *Becoming — Michelle Obama*

> “As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end”

> “Failure is a feeling long before it becomes an actual result. It’s vulnerability that breeds with self-doubt and then is escalated, often deliberately, by fear”

> “This is what a control freak learns inside the compressed otherworld of college, maybe above all else: There are simply other ways of being.”

> “None of this was his fault, but it wasn’t equal, either, and for any woman who lives by the mantra that equality is important, this can be a little confusing”

> “It was similar to when the Sidwell mom had asked Malia if she feared for her life at tennis practice. What can you do, really, but go out and hit another ball?”

#### *Killing Commendatore — Haruki Murakami*

> “Thelonious Monk did not get those unusual chords as a result of logic or theory. He opened his eyes wide, and scooped those chords out from the darkness of his consciousness.”

> “Namely, to determine to ‘stop thinking’ about something is itself a thought — as long as one follows that path, that something continues to exist. In the end, to stop thinking about something means to stop thinking about stopping thinking.”

#### *Information, Incentives and Education Policy — Derek A. Neal*
