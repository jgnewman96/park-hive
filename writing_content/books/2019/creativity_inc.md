*Creativity Inc* was a fantastic book looking at the culture of Pixar. It explained the founding of Pixar and how the founders maintain an intense focus on developing a fantastic culture. The founders believe that if they maintain a good culture, their business will thrive. A successful business is not about having a great product plan, but developing a good culture and empowering smart people.

I appreciated that the book did not prescribe easy solutions but discussed everything with nuance. It recognized that there are tradeoffs between different approaches. It was honest about how problems are difficult and that there will always be problems. It never felt like it was oversimplifying how difficult running a company can be.

I am excited to return to this book at a later date and see how my thoughts about it have changed. So much of what the book talked about aligned deeply with my personal values. I loved the intense focus on putting people in a situation to succeed and trusting people. That everything else will work itself out, if your core values are good and you follow them.

While this book was about how to create a good company culture, almost everything the book talked about applies to how to live a good life. It is so important to take some of the things that the book talked about and implement them in your own live. There are going to be problems and things are going to be difficult at times. It is not about avoiding problems or avoiding fear, it is about how we respond to them and how we work through them.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone.

#### Quotes

> Even though we were conscious that a room’s dynamics are critical to any good discussion, even though we
believed that we were constantly on the lookout for problems, our vantage point blinded us to what was right
before our eyes.

<!-- -->

> Kids are instinctively there. But a lot of them unlearn it. Or people tell them they can’t or it’s impractical. So
yes, kids have to grow up, but maybe there’s a way to suggest that they could be better off if they held onto
some of their childish ideas.

<!-- -->
> You need storms. It’s like an ecology. To view lack of conflict as optimum is like saying a sunny day is
optimum. A sunny day is when the sun wins out over the rain. There’s no conflict. You have a clear winner. But
if every day is sunny and it doesn’t rain, things don’t grow. And if it’s sunny all the time—if, in fact, we don’t
ever even have night—all kinds of things don’t happen and the planet dries up. The key is to view conflict as
essential, because that’s how we know the best ideas will be tested and survive. You know, it can’t only be
sunlight

<!-- -->

> Our view of the past, in fact, is hardly clearer than our view of the future. While we know more about a past
event than a future one, our understanding of the factors that shaped it is severely limited.

> Instead, I prefer to think of data as one way of seeing, one of many tools we can use to look for what’s hidden.

> Trust doesn’t mean that you trust that someone won’t screw up—it means you trust them even when they do
screw up.
