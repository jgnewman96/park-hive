*There Eyes Were Watching God* is a novel about Janie, an African American Women born shortly after the end of slavery. The novel follows her she moves through three different husbands and living situations. This book is the most well known piece of literature by Zora Neale Hurston. The book is often read in English classes in either high school or college. I never read *There Eyes Were Watching God* in school; I was in the other 10th grade english class.

The version of the book that I read contained a forward, an introduction and an afterword. While the forward and the introduction probably should have been at the end of the book, it was nice to read scholars thoughts on Hurston's work. It helped me contextualize what I was reading. I was able to better understand the circumstances which created this and why this story is important. I was fascinated by Hurston's interactions with other writers and how other writers felt about her work.

The largest theme or lesson that spoke to me from this book was the necessity of learning from experience and living our own life. Hurston does an incredible job conveying Janie's internal monologue and her feelings of want. Janie marries two men that do not leave her happy or satisfied. The first marriage was set up by her grandmother, in an attempt to provide Janie with security. Janie jumps into the second marriage attempting to run away is trying from the first marriage. She wants to find a better situation, leading her to run away with a man shortly after first meeting him.

This made me reflect on the importance of dating while you are young. We learn so much from experiences with different partners. Through each partner we will learn more about ourselves and what it means to be in a relationship. These experiences make us smarter and wiser for future relationships. This is a two pronged sword though. We often carry around the baggage and hurt from previous relationships. We also have to learn how to work through trauma / history that we are carrying around with us.

This thought highlights the importance of everyone living their own life and learning from their own experience. While it is important to convey wisdom and learn from others, everyone has to learn on their own. Individuals will learn the most from their own experiences, not just being told by others.

## Quotes

>  Many of us argued that Janie did not have to be a role model at all. She simply had to be a fully realized and complex character, which she was.

> There are years that ask questions and years that answer.

<!-- -->

> Then there is a depth of thought untouched by words, and deeper still a gulf of formless feelings untouched by thought.
