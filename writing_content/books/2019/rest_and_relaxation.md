*My Year of Rest and Relaxation* by Otessa Moshfegh is quite a trip. The reader is taken inside the mind of a young adult living in New York who is trying to sleep for a entire year. The main character's parents died and she recently left her job. She is using medication to sleep as much as possible. She hopes that after a year of sleeping she will be able to have a new start and be divorced from the darkness of her previous life.

The book is dark, biting, and very funny at times. The book reminded me how complicated everyone's internal monologue can be. I am so often wrapped up in my internal monologue that I forget everyone around me is having an equally complicated one at the same time.

The book also made me think about how easy it is for people to feel lonely and fall through the cracks post college. Up until college everyone has a strong support system with people all around them. Post college that can change a lot. There is no one checking up on you or looking out for you in the same way.

> The notion of my future suddenly snapped into focus: it didn’t exist yet. I was making it, standing there, breathing, fixing the air around my body with stillness, trying to capture something—a thought, I guess—as though such a thing were possible, as though I believed in the delusion described in those paintings—that time could be contained, held captive. I didn’t know what was true.
