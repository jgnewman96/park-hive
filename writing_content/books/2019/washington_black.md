Washington Black by *Esi Edugyan* was quite an enjoyable piece of historical fiction. Here are a couple of different themes that personally stuck out to me.

## Science as an equalizer

The book played around a couple of different times with the idea that science and viewing the world through a scientific lens is an equalizer. That if you viewed the world through a scientific lens then you would not discriminate against certain people and you would be better able to see the truth. In the end the book did not really take a definitive stance on this. Sometimes it seemed to champion this view but in other ways it actually argued against it.

Your thoughts on the character Titch relate a great deal to how you think the book answered this question. If you view Titch as someone who took advantage of Washington and was just using him, then the book does not show science to be an equalizer. But if you believe that Titch truly cared about Washington and was not using slaves as an equalizer than science it would seem to be an equalizer.


## Trauma

For me, this entire book was about trauma; how trauma continues to affects us after it has happened and how we can begin to move past trauma. Washington had a number of very traumatic events happen to him when he was quite young. The whole book is about him trying to come to terms with this trauma. Washington's approach was trying to seek out the people who were part of that trauma. He feels like he has to find Titch or that he needs to go talk to Kit.

I think putting the ability to work through trauma on others is a dangerous game. It would be nice if when Washington went and talked to Titch, Titch said things that helped him. But you cannot expect that off other people. While it might be harder, it is such an important skill to learn how to work through trauma on your own.

## Not having to make an argument

One of the most meaningful things about fictions and the arts is that each piece does not have to make a coherent argument. When you write an essay you are supposed to make an argument and have a definitive stance. But pieces of fiction can explore topics and show all the gray areas. They do not have to take a definitive stance but rather can affect each reader differently and have ambiguities. Often pieces of fiction can actually have a larger impact than a persuasive essay because of this.

the only, nor the best, values in existence.

going from place to place until I made her like me, so lacking a foothold anywhere that nowhere felt like home.
