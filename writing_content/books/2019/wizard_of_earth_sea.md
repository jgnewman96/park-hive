I read this book because of a recommendation from my friend Hawkins. I had previously read a couple of other books by Ursula Le Guin. I absolutely loved both *Left Hand of Darkness* and *The Dispossessed*. Both were sci-fi books that were actually commentaries on human society. I cannot get enough of books like that. Hawk had mentioned that this book was about a communist society and what that would look like. I did not really see that at all in the first book but maybe that happens later in the series.

This book read much more like a young adult novel than the other books I had read by Le Guin. That is because this book was written as a young adult novel. I wonder if knowing that before I read the book would have changed my perspective.

The book was quite enjoyable to read though. It reminded me of reading Harry Potter and my childhood a lot. I was frustrated through out the book about how simple the characters seemed and how rudimentary their motivations were. There can be a lot of power though in simple characters. This book spoke to me in terms of self discovery and how we change over time. It also showed how traumatic events can really shape a person and their development.

Le Guin wrote an afterward that accompanied later versions of the book. The afterword explained how the novel was created. She explained how in a lot of ways this book broke the traditional trends of the literature without anyone knowing it. She explained that the main characters in the novel had dark skin and people did not even realize that. By writing a simple young adult novel she was able to hide some powerful things. This book might have set up the ways she later wrote very harsh critiques of society but disguised them as sci-fi books. The afterword really changed the way I thought about the book.

There are quite a number of sci-fi series where I only read the first book and did not continue with the series (*The Fifth Season*, *The Three Body Problem*). I will hopefully continue to read this series because I do really love Le Guin's writing.
