*The Omnivore's Dilemma* by Michael Pollan was an absolutely fascinating read. I enjoyed learning more about our food insutry and how the human food chain has developed. The central question of the book was where does our food come from? What seems like such a simple question has become quite complex in our modern society. I learned a lot by watching Michael try to answer this question.

- While this book dealt explicitly with our food chain, it raises a lot of questions about the complexity of our society today. Food is something that on the surface is simple and essential to our day to day society. It is crazy how certain processes have developed without careful thought about the pros and cons of certain approaches.

- The book brought up a number of times about how the government subsidizes the production of corn. It argues that this has been very bad for the farming industry and our food chain in general because the demand for food is inelastic. This means that even as the price of food drops, for the most part the demand of food is stable. I am curious for someone to take a careful look at the economics of our food chain and if subsidizing farmers makes economic sense.

- One other part of the book that was very interesting to me was the discussions about how we can understand our own behavior in the context of evolution and food. Our actions are mostly dependent on the time when we evolved which is when we were hunter and gatherers. Can we better understand ourselves if we think about the hunter/gatherer context and what kind of traits would have been necessary to thrive in that context.

## Quotes

> As a relatively new nation drawn from many different immigrant populations, each with its own culture of food,
Americans have never had a single, strong, stable culinary tradition to guide us.

<!-- -->

> Indeed, there is every reason to believe that corn has succeeded in domesticating us.

> The economics of a family farm are very different than a firm’s: When prices fall, the firm can lay off people,
idle factories, and make fewer widgets. Eventually the market finds a new balance between supply and demand.
But the demand for food isn’t elastic; people don’t eat more just because food is cheap. And laying off farmers
doesn’t help to reduce supply.


<!-- -->
> To the contrary, a healthy sense of all we don’t know—even a sense of mystery—keeps us from reaching for
oversimplifications and technological silver bullets.

<!-- -->

> Like fresh air and sunshine, Joel believes transparency is a more powerful disinfectant than any regulation or
technology.

> Is the individual the crucial moral entity in nature as we’ve decided it should be in human society? We simply
may require a different set of ethics to guide our dealings with the natural world, one as well suited to the
particular needs of plants and animals and habitats (where sentience counts for little) as rights seem to suit us
and serve our purposes today.
