**Why I read it**: I saw the book in the book store at Spirit Rock when I was doing a meditation retreat there a couple of years ago.



## Quotes

> Will we express the promise of and commitment to liberation for all beings, or will we instead continue a hyper-individualized salvation model—the myth of meritocracy—that is the foundation of this country’s untruth?

<!-- -->

> We can’t marginalize others or ourselves as part of our pursuit of liberation, personal or political.

<!-- -->

> Fundamentally one of the questions at the seat of Dharma is desire. So it is very interesting that desire, in terms of sexuality, is rather seldomly spoken about.

<!-- -->

>  They may not be talking about it, but everyone’s having similar experiences, because we all have mind, and mind has these experiences that we don’t really know how to work with.

<!-- -->

> I want to say that a part of me doesn’t feel good enough, that this was a feeling I was born into, trained in, and encouraged to accept—that I do not remember an experience before this.

<!-- -->

> When I speak of trauma, I speak of experiences that impact how we relate to ourselves and to others around us

<!-- -->

> It’s not inherently a problem that I’m anything, but the way that I relate to that often as a result of a collective social identity and social way of relating to it—that’s actually where the problem lies.

<!-- -->

> Meditation is not the primary practice for most Buddhists in the world. The thick number of people who practice meditation would be here in the States and in the UK. I think it’s not an accident that white convert sanghas are putting such a strong emphasis on non-relational ways of developing their sanghas.

> Like I said, you can relax anywhere. We waste sangha and community when we choose not to engage in discomfort associated with liberatory practice.
