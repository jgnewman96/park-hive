**Where I found it**: Book Club (see note below)

**Why I wanted to read it**: Book Club (see note below)

I reached out to my friend from college [Maidson](https://www.thegirlandthelamb.com/about) to see if she was interested in starting a book club together. Recently I had been wanting to dive deeper into some of the books I was reading. I missed the experience of reading books in school and have lengthy discussions about them. A book club seemed like a great way to interact with some books in more depth and a good way to keep in touch with some friends! After reaching out to Madison she actually did almost all of the work of getting the group up and running. We got together a group of some of our college friends and decided on the following structure. 
    - Meet every two weeks
    - Read one book a month. This means breaking every book into two halves
    - Create a shared document that we can put thoughts and notes in after we read but before discussion
    - We want to read sets of books that follow a theme. In this way the books should hopefully build on top of each other. With each theme we pick someone around six books to read in that theme

I loved reading this book as part of a book club. Just knowing that I was going to discuss the book made me read in more depths and come up with topics that I wanted to explore further. My understanding of the book was also so enriched by discussing it through with the group. Each person brought their own perspective and understanding. After seeing how much deeper my understanding of this book is from discussing it, I wonder how much I might be missing out on some other books. 

Breaking the book into two halves was a little odd. I think meeting every two weeks and one book a month is about the correct pace though. 

__Note: Since I discussed this book at book club this write-up is derived from those conversations. This means it includes not just my own thoughts but rather what stuck out to me the most from our discussions. All credit goes to the rest of the people in the book club__

**Quick Plot Summary**

This book has a lot to say about love and the ways that it impacts us. One of the interesting parts of this book though, is how it puts some much interpretation and understanding on the reader. In a lot of the books I have read the author or narrator does a lot of the work for you. The author clearly has a message they want to get across and that message comes through loud and clearly. But with this book the narrator has a very passive voice. 

After having finished the book it becomes clear that the book has quite a negative take on love. Multiple times love is compared to getting sick with cholera. In all places in the book love is a destructive force that is putting everyone into terrible situations. But because of the narrators tone and how the story is told, this take away was not immediately apparent to me as I was reading the book. Only when I was able to take a stab back and clearly evaluate what each character was experiencing was this apparent. 

My experience of reading this book is similar to what the book has to say about love. We are so caught up in pursuing love and being in love that we are not able to objectively evaluate what is happening. If we were to take that step back we would see that the experience is harmful and painful. Not being able to see something truly because we are in the middle of it shows up in other places in the book as well. The residents in the city are not able to see that the city is failing into disarray and decay. They do not see that the river is being destroyed and that they are destroying nature. Only when characters go away for a long time and then come back are they able to see the destruction. 

The book portrays Florentino as a man who causes lots of harm and destruction in his sole pursuit of this love. He is constantly trying to seduce other harm and brings them a lot of harm through his actions. But the portrayal of Fermina is also interesting to think about. Fermina seems like she is constantly trapped by different men. She is never able to get away from men pursuing her. Fermina also never really seems to be happy. She is constantly trying to set out her own path and define who she is and not listen to others. After rejecting Florentino when she is younger she eventually gives in to him when she is older.

After reading __Love in the Time of Cholera__ the group decided to do an arc on Latin American and Latinx writers. The next book we are reading is __A Long Petal Of The Sea__ by Isabel Allende.

> That we vibrate to one another should be a life-enhancing fact, but this third modernity amplifies our mutual vibration to an excruciating pitch. In the milieu of total instrumentation, it is less that we resonate to one another’s presence and more that we drown in its inescapability.
