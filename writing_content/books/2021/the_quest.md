By [Daniel Yergin](https://www.danielyergin.com/)

**Why I read it**: After reading this [essay](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/Study-the-Past-Create-the-Future) I was inspired to read more books about history. [Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/) had mentioned The Prize by Yergin a few times so I was interested in reading that book. When I looked for The Prize, the library did not have it but they did have the The Quest, so I decided to read it instead.

## Thoughts

* Reading this book inspired me and made feel a lot more optimistic about climate change and the world's relationship to energy. Learning about the history and how things have changed over time gave me a lot of perspective. In the energy industry, it takes a long time for things to change. It is very different then in my day to day with software. Someone can spin up a new company or piece of software in months. Making large scale changes to how we consume energy takes a long time. Just because we are not seeing immediate changes does not mean they are not happening. 

* That just means I should feel less despair when it feels like things arent changing. This book demonstrated how our understanding of climate change has already caused lots of shifts in the energy industry. Those changes and their impact will take time to manifest though. But I do believe they will manifest and that humanity will have a more sustainable relationship with energy. Our increased energy usage is a by product of billions of people having increased quality of lives. 

* [The Color Of Law](/#/post/color_of_law) is a book I read last year about housing policy and how it is has purposely caused inequality by race. The book argues that since housing policy did this, it is a problem we made and we have the requirement to fix it. But also because we deliberately caused this problem, we can also fix it. I feel the same way about our relationship with energy consumption. Just as we are the reason we have gotten into this mess, we can also be the reason we get out of it. 

* Some necessary parts of our energy solution will be: 
    * Developed countries have to really step up here. This whole rhetoric about wanting developing countries to do their part is so harmful. Developing countries are increasing their energy usage because people are coming out of poverty. That is what developing countries should be focusing on.
    * While we should be shifting more towards renewables we should also be shifting away from fossil fuels that are more harmful. Switch away from coal to natural gas. Switch from natural gas to nuclear. 
    * Electric cars are going to help so much. One of the main problems with renewables is demand and supply are not matched. Electric cars can act as millions of mobile batteries that can store energy and then also give energy. 
    * Dynamic pricing of electricity seems like a promising direction.this involves conveying prices to people in real time and having people's demand respond to those prices. There are a lot of logistical burdens but it would make demand much more responsive to supply. There is also the difficulty of doing dynamic pricing with such an important basic asset. It is important that everyone has the ability to access cheap electricity. You could imagine a solution that involved a fixed price up to a certain amount and then the more you used, the more price increases.

* We need more ways for basic R & D on really important issues to be funded besides the government. The book talks about how government R & D would increase and then decrease demanding on who was in power. This lack of a consistent funding made it difficult for continuos progress on research. There should be different ways for basic research to be funded so that researchers know they have a consistent source of funding and can focus most of their energy on their projects. 

* In the history of energy, the U.S. government has struggled to get laws passed. It can be very difficult to get legislation through both houses in congress. This has meant that energy policy often comes from organizations and regulation rather than a law being passed. These organizations are limited in their ability of what they can do. This means the situation we end up is often second best or even worse. 

* The amount of work that must have gone into creating this book is staggering. There must have been so much research. The book talks about such specific details of so many different things. 


## Quotes

> “An [oil] price spike is bad for everyone but worst for developing countries that have oil,” he had concluded. “It is a trap.”

<!-- -->

> The sudden increase of prices at the pump took purchasing power away from lower-income groups, making it more difficult for many of them to make payments on their subprime mortgages and their other debts. The higher cost of the gasoline they needed to get to work meant trade-offs in terms of what else they could spend elsewhere. (talking about the financial collapse of 2008)

<!-- -->

> Or to put it more sharply, the United States and Europe have outsourced part of their energy consumption to China.

<!-- -->

> Even competitive markets are, after all, not exactly free. They depend, crucially, on the rules by which they operate.


<!-- -->

> nuclear power’s great advantages are not only the traditional ones of fuel diversification and self-sufficiency. It is also the only large-scale, well-established, broadly deployable source of electric generation currently available that is carbon free.

<!-- -->

> It is too risky to overcommit to one approach when technology, expected fuel costs, regulation, public opinion, and ranking of risks can change sometimes with abrupt speed. Diversification is the basic strategy for protecting against uncertainty and unexpected change.

<!-- -->

> The first is world population, which has almost tripled since 1950. The equation is simple: more people use more energy—which leads to more carbon emissions. The second is rising incomes. World GDP has also tripled since 1950, and energy use rises as incomes rise.

<!-- -->

> As the world turns over its capital stock—of buildings, vehicles, equipment, and factories—efficiency will be enhanced, because they will embody higher standards of efficiency.

<!-- -->

> Lee Kuan Yew, the founder and former prime minister of modern Singapore, once described air-conditioning as “the most important invention of the twentieth century,” because, he explained, it enabled the people of the tropics to become productive.

<!-- -->


> For it was really a reconnection with a cultural tradition of thrift and care that was deeply embedded in a historical experience shaped by limited land and stringency in resources. This orientation contrasts with America’s historical experience, which is based on ample land and abundant resources and a vaster and more confident geography.

<!-- -->

> “While other fuels need ‘hard’ infrastructure like pipe and transmission lines,” energy efficiency requires its own infrastructure of “public policy support, education and awareness and innovative financing tools.” There are also technologies that need to be integrated into that infrastructure

<!-- -->

> If the electric car becomes common, the smart meter would also play a crucial role in managing recharging so that it is done late at night, off-peak, when demand is the lightest. The smart meter can do one more thing: verify energy savings. That could be essential if the utility is “paying” people to be more energy efficient.

<!-- -->

> In other words, regulation can be a second-best solution, at least from an economist’s perspective, but a more doable solution from a political prospective.

<!-- -->

> This increase is really a measure of success—of a more prosperous global economy, of rising standards of living, of billions of people moving out of poverty.

<!-- -->

> It is really after 2030 that the energy system could start to look quite different as the cumulative effect of innovation and technological advance makes its full impact felt.
