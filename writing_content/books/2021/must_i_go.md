**Where I found  it**: I read this piece by [Yiyun Li](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/16/the-ability-to-cry) in the New Yorker and then was interested to read more. The library had this book so I check it out.

**Why I wanted to read it**: I enjoyed the piece she wrote in the New Yorker and was interested in reading some of her fiction.

__Must I Go__ is told by an older women Lilia who lives in a nursing home. The book focuses on her life and her relationship to her family. The book is told through journal entries of Roland, one of her early lovers, and her commentary on Roland's journal entries. Lilia's first daughter, Lucy, was conceived with Roland. Lilia never told anyone besides her husband that Roland is Lucy's father. Lucy killed herself when she was in her twenties.

Must of the books that I read do not have a protagonist that is as old as Lilia. THis book was told as Lilia looking back at her life where as in most fiction I read people are thinking about the present or the future and not the past. Lilia from the beginning of the book is clearly a very guarded women. As we learn more about Lilia during the book it really feels like she starts to open up more and show us who she is. We learn more about her relationship with Lucy and how she feels about Roland. At first it seemed to me like there might have been a change in Lilia through out the book but it was more just that she actually started expressing her emotions more deeply.

This book has a pretty intense focus on death. Or more precisely death surrounds everything in this book. Lucy's death hangs over the entire book and many of the characters are forced to deal with death. Lilia many times over takes about how death is not that big of a deal to her. But Lucy's death clearly impacted her in a very major way.

After finishing this book, I am still not sure how I feel about it. I enjoyed reading it and thought the characters were very interesting. The plot is not particularly gripping, but I was motivated to learn more about the characters back stories and how they became the people they are.

I’m telling you, the most deadly natural disaster that can befall anyone is family. And where can you look for a shelter when that disaster hits?

I see through him, too, but only now. Before his death and before reading his diaries I didn’t take him for who he was, but for who he was to me, and to Lucy. Perhaps I also took Lucy as who she was to me, and to Roland, instead of who she was. But who was Lucy

People asking such questions are only trying to make life into a solvable puzzle. Real life? It misses important pieces and has useless extras.
