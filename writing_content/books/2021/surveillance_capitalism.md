By [Shoshana Zuboff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff)

**Where I found  it**: This book was popped up in many different places for me. I cannot pinpoint one place where I first heard about it but most recently one my former co-workers mentioned that she wanted to read it.   

**Why I wanted to read it**: I think a lot about how technology and specifically large technology companies interact with society. This seemed like an important piece of work that would help give me a concrete framework to think about these relationships.

Wow, I feel like this book brought out a lot of feelings in me. Feelings not really about the content itself but more about how the content was presented and the arguments that were made. I am quite disappointed in this book. A lot of individual compelling points were made and it clearly was supported by a lot of intensive research, but the book did not connect together or make one overarching comprehensive argument. It did not provide a framework as it promises. I felt that the tone of the book is too sure of itself and does not actually explore the difficulties and tradeoffs that have to be made. 

Yes, the book did a really good job highlighting difficulties and problems with our current large tech organizations and their relationship to society. If the only purpose of the book was to make people reflect on their relationship to these organizations it did its job. But Zuboff did not interrogate the actual benefits that people receive from these large tech organizations. When discussing why we have reached this point, Zuboff focused on the different lobbying and deceit tactics that tech companies have taken. A huge part of the difficulty moving forward is that people have gained immense benefit from Facebook and Google. That does not mean we should be complacent about the role they play in our society. We should be actively thinking about what we want our society to look like and creating policy that helps bring it about. But Zuboff presented the whole situation as very cut and dry with good guys and bad guys. 

The other part I found very difficult about Zuboff's rhetoric was that she just assumed certain properties are desirable and did not explain how certain things cause harm. Zuboff constantly was talking about how much data tech companies collect about individuals. But why is tech companies collecting data bad? What are the harms that it causes and in what ways? What are some alternatives? 

This book was really difficult because there are a lot of points that I connect with, but the overall structure, argument and rhetoric were lacking. 

* * *  

In the first section of the book Zuboff introduces all these new terms and explains Google and Facebook's business models. But including new terms and by arguing that what they are doing is unprecedented she obfuscates her argument. Google and Facebook both run ad based business models. They receive money not from the people who are using their service but from advertisers who want to put their content it front of users. This misalignment can cause a lot of problems. Facebook and Google have taken this to the extreme because so many people use both services and because of the amount of data that they collect about individuals. But at its core the problem is this misalignment in ad based business models. Ad based business models have been around before Google and Facebook as well.

Zuboff then later in the book focuses on the problems with tech exceptionalism and utopianism is. Many people in tech world are focused on bringing about this utopia they envision with technology, but when you further interrogate it, it might not actually be a utopia. This and the scope of the ad based business model that Facebook and Google both run is problematic. Because Google and Facebook do provide real value they have grown into these large corporations with immense amount of power. But Zuboff did not do a good job connecting all of these different parts together and the relationship between them. She treated all of them as one large thing and did not break down the different problematic parts. I would have loved to see the following rhetoric layed out more cleanly. 
    - Facebook and Google provide a real service to users that is valuable. 
    - Rather than have users pay for this service, FB and Google decided to monetize through advertisements. 
    - This creates incentives where FB and Google want to keep users on the platform but really their revenue and success is driven by advertisers and not users
    - By collecting a lot of data on individuals FB and Google have been able to deliver a vast superior advertizing experience to many people. Especially people who previously may not have been able to afford advertizing. 
    - FB and Google have been able to re-invest this money to continue to grow their platforms, branch out into other business and just generally amass a very large amount of power. 
    - Many people in the tech industry (and everywhere else tbh) have visions of bringing about a utopia through their platform and this is quite problematic because their platforms have actually given them a lot of power to directly influence society. 

I feel like this understanding is a lot easier to wrap my head around and provides a more accessible place to start looking at harms and thinking about how to bring about a better relationship between these companies and society.

Some other quick hits: 

- The connection between tech companies and the state after 9 / 11 was so interesting. This was not something I knew much about. Just in general the connection between these tech companies and the role they play with government is fascinating. It feels like 9 / 11 impacted the US so much in so many different ways. 
- The section on pokemon go was also really interesting. I remember when pokemon go briefly blew up over the summer but did not know how pokemon go tried to monetize. This section also highlights my problems with this book really well. Zuboff never talks about why people liked pokemon go. Why was being on pokemon go attractive to people? How could we have imagined a pokemon go alternative that is actually what we wanted? 
- Privacy policies at this point are such bullshit. This is one space that really needs a lot of reform. No one ever reads them and if you do they are so inaccessible.

The best part about this book is how it makes me think really deeply about what society I want to live in. What do I want the checks and balances to be in that society and who do I want to have power? It really forces the reader to reflect on what they want their relationship with these companies to be. 

I also really loved Zuboff's focus on the power of popular movements. Policy follows popular movements. I feel like I have not heard this rhetoric before but it is really powerful. It gives much more agency to individuals in shaping the future. 

The most disappointing part about this book though is that Zuboff never articulates what policy or changes she is in favor of. We know what Zuboff is against but we do not know what she is for!

## Quotes

> There is no end of history; each generation must assert its will and imagination as new threats require us to retry the case in every age.

<!-- -->

> the individual as the author of his or her own life is the protagonist of our age, whether we experience this fact as emancipation or affliction.

<!-- -->

> For now we can recognize that over the centuries we have imagined threat in the form of state power. This left us wholly unprepared to defend ourselves from new companies with imaginative names run by young geniuses that seemed able to provide us with exactly what we yearn for at little or no cost

> Traditionally, monopolies on goods and services disfigure markets by unfairly eliminating competition in order to raise prices at will. Under surveillance capitalism, however, many of the practices defined as monopolistic actually function as means of cornering user-derived raw-material supplies. There is no monetary price for the user to pay, only an opportunity for the company to extract data.

> Most simply put, there is no freedom without uncertainty; it is the medium in which human will is expressed in promises.

> That we vibrate to one another should be a life-enhancing fact, but this third modernity amplifies our mutual vibration to an excruciating pitch. In the milieu of total instrumentation, it is less that we resonate to one another’s presence and more that we drown in its inescapability.

> This was not intended as a statement of misanthropy but rather a recognition that the self-other balance can never be adequately struck as long as the “others” are constantly “watching.”
