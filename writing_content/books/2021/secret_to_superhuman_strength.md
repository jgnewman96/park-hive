By [Alison Bechdel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Bechdel)
  

**Why I read it**:  On my first date with Jenny, I bought one of Bechdel's other graphic novels [Are you My Mother?](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C0YN19G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). I absolutely loved it. When I was in Chicago over the summer my friend Dylan recomended her most recent graphic novel. When we saw it in a store in Boulder, CO we decided to get it. It ended up taking me a while to actually get around to reading it. 

Since the book is a graphic novel, I won't have any of my favorite quotes from it. Instead here are a few scattered thoughts about why I enjoyed the book so much. 

- I love how Bechdel connects her own thinking with writers who have come before her. She does such a good job of connecting different thinkers and how they have thought about similar things. She often highlights the ways they have influenced each other and her. It creates this dialogue where people are thinking about the same issue and building upon each others eyes. I know that I am influenced in so many ways by the things that I read. I love how Bechdel puts other's writing at the front of her work. 

- It is fascinating to see how Bechdel connects her own exercise and fitness regimens with her creative practice. I have personally found that exercise is so important to my own mental health and well being. Exercise is actually something that is energy creating. 

- Bechdel's creative process is such a demanding and intense one. She talked a lot about struggling with deadlines and working really hard. She would then crash afterwards. I think there is an important balance to find. Sometimes it can be really important to follow your energy. When you are on a high you should ride the wave and let carry you. And when you are not feeling it then maybe it is best not to work. But it can also be really important to have some regimen. This is something I feel like I want to devote more thought to. 

- The novel chronicled all of Bechdel's life. It was fascinating to see all the different athletic pursuits she tried. To see how she found running at an early age. abandoned it and then later came back to it. It can be so impressive sometimes how much people can accomplish in a lifetime and how much things can change. I felt a similar feeling watching David Attenborough's recent documentary [A Life on Our Planet](https://www.netflix.com/title/80216393). 

- In Bechdel's graphic novels while there is one main topic, she is often writing about many things. While she was focusing on exercise and self improvement, at the same time she was also writing about her family and relationships. 

- I loved the focus on clothing in the book and how she highlighted different pieces of clothing that are important to her. 

- Throughout the book, I am pretty sure there was one illustration of each president on TV. They were all cute to see. 

- I feel like a lot of thinkers I really respect and admire have talked up the Dharma Bums. The Dharma Bums is the only book in the past four years I have started that I did not finish. I really could not get through it. I have no idea why people like it so much....
