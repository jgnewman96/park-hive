**Where I found  it**: I read a number of really good pieces about the coronavirus by Ed Yong this year. I was impressed by the depth of his reporting. I was listening to an interview of Yong on the [longform podcast](https://longform.org/) and heard him mention this book. 

**Why I wanted to read it**: After being so impressed by Yong's reporting on Covid I was really excited to read more by him. Microbiome was a term I had heard in the abstract before, but did not really know anything about.

Yong's book provides an introduction to bacteria and all of the roles they play in our world. This book is less about concrete health advice and more about how understanding bacteria forces us to rethink some scientific principles. We might have previously viewed  a human as a distinctive form of life, but there are actually thousands of bacteria living inside and on us at all times. In their own way each of them is also a distinct life form. So what are we then? Are we one life form or many life forms cohabiting together? 

Yong also challenges narratives around how evolution is taught. Yong makes it clear that evolution as we know it is not incompatible with what he discusses in this book, but by only looking at evolution we miss other phenomena in nature. We miss how species work and change together. How cooperation actually happens all over the place. When we only focus on survival of the fittest and view evolution kind of like competition we miss the richness and diversity of how life has changed.

Only focusing on evolution and missing other phenomena has implications for how our society functions. There are many individuals who love to espouse the benefits of competition and how competition allows the best ideas and methods to succeed. While competition can be good there are also other methods by which we can bring about great ideas. Looking towards bacteria and how they have changed with other species over time might provide another direction. 

Research about bacteria is still a very young and fast developing field. A lot of the work that Yong covers in this book is relatively recent work. It is not clear yet what the health implications are from learning more about bacteria and the role they play in our lives. I am excited to see more research progress made in this direction and how it might impact the ways we think about our own health.

## Quotes

> Our lives are heavily influenced by external forces that are actually inside us, by trillions of things that are separate from us and yet very much a part of us.

<!-- -->

> The immune system isn’t just a means of controlling microbes. It is at least partly controlled by microbes. It’s yet another route through which our multitudes preserve our bodies.

<!-- -->

> In the great evolutionary race, they sprint, while we crawl. But we can get a little closer to their blinding pace by forming partnerships with them. Bacteria, in other words, allow us to do decent impressions of bacteria.

<!-- -->

> Within 24 hours of moving into a new place we overwrite it with our own microbes, turning it into a reflection of ourselves.
