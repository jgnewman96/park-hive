**Where I found  it**: My older brother Jake recommended it to me. 

**Why I wanted to read it**: My girlfriend Jenny read it after my brother suggested it and absolutely loved it. With two praising reviews from people close to me I had no choice but to read it.

__A Place for Us__ is going to be in contention for one of the best books that I read in 2021. The prose is quite striking and Mirza captures such relatable and strong feelings so well. This book covered family and siblings in a way that is not done by many other books. The story is about a family with three children living in California. They are practicing Muslim's navigating what it means to raise kids in a place with different norms then the parents were raised. Different members of the family provide their own perspective and we see how the family develops and relationships change as the kids grow up. 

I have recently been fascinated with how authors use time to create tension and mystery in stories. Now that I am looking for it I see the technique of authors telling a story from multiple time periods everywhere. A story will start at one point in time and then jump back and forth to different time periods. This use of time creates a tension and mystery that propels the reader to want more. We want to connect these different points in time and understand how they connect. We are looking to uncover the story that bridges us from one point to the other. Mirza does this so well. After the first chapter we immediately want to read more to understand what happened to this family and specifically what is going on with Amar. 

This novel captures the difficulties and conflicting feelings of being in a family so well. It captures how you might be scared and frustrated of your father but also want to please him more than anything. How you might love your sibling and want to see them do well, but also sometimes feel good when you do better than them. I remember having conflicting feelings like this growing up and them being so overpowering. I would feel such guilt at times that I would feel conflicting feelings in relationship to my family and then feel bad that I was feeling that guilt. 

I enjoyed how Mirza had multiple family members as narrators. It allowed the reader to gain a more holistic perspective and see how any of the characters an unreliable narrator. We can see the differences between how the individuals in the family view themselves and how others in the family view them. It provides a powerful look at how each of us are only living one unique experience and may be missing or distorting what is going on with each other. 

I highly highly recommend reading __A Place for Us__. 

## Quotes

> Sometimes he surprises her with his lenience, other times it is his strict adherence that unsettles her. She could guess, but could never accurately predict, where he would stand on a matter.

<!-- -->

> He wondered, on the drive, how they would address what had happened. And now he sees it is as easy as saying “knew” instead of “know.”

<!-- -->

> He has been rude to them lately, to everyone, angry all the time without really knowing why. He should try harder. He loves them. He knows that. It is easier to feel it here, after this walk, drinking soda in the sun, than it is when they are home.

<!-- -->

> She always sensed conditions to their parents’ love and so she did nothing to threaten it. Amar sensed the same and only thought to test its limits. See how far he could push them before they left him.


> that it was not her he was fighting for so much as what life with her would represent and promise him


> What she could ever hope to know of him was just a glimpse—like the beam of a lighthouse skipping out, only one stretch of waves visible at a time, the rest left in the unknowable dark.
