By [Audre Lorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audre_Lorde)

**Where I found  it**: I have read numerous other pieces that have recommended Lorde's writing. My roommate Andrew read this book and said it was really good.  

**Why I wanted to read it**: I have found that older works that people still recommend to be some of the absolute best. If something was published a long time ago but people are still reading it and feel it is relevant than it clearly is a very insightful and important piece of work.

As you might be able to tell from all the quotes I included below, I found Lorde's essays powerful, reflective and quite unique. There were ideas she expressed that felt so strong and powerful that I have not seen else where. Lorde's thoughts on the role difference plays in our lives was so powerful. Difference is something we are constantly scared of and working against. Lorde directly calls this out and talks about how we must not only tolerate difference, but see it as strength and a creative force. This resonated with me in many different ways. It resonated in the ways that I have seen diversity and people coming from different backgrounds have some of the most meaningful experiences. It also spoke to ways I have seen differences scare people and not being able to understand or work with difference. 

These essays made me reflect on my previous job working in the political sphere. One of the things I disliked the most about working in politics was how difference was handled. Politics treated people who were different then you as enemies and that we did not even want to understand them. That we had to beat them and essentially did not even see the humanity in other people. That is such a disheartening and difficult space to be in. 

Lorde's essays also made me think about how much US history is just straight propaganda. I have had this thought multiple times recently in different contexts but Lorde's essays showed me how broad that propaganda is. I had reflected on it with regard to race, but Lorde also talks about it with regard to communism and socialism. It is absolutely crazy how much a fear and hatred for communism and socialism is put forth in our country. I realized that I actually know almost nothing about the Cold War and Russia and what life was like there. I have just been told this narrative of communism being bad and that a democracy is the only way to possibly organize a country. 

Another great part of Lorde's essays were her reflections on anger and hatred. How anger and hatred can become so dominant in our society and when we show hatred it then propagates. People receive hatred and then in turn put that hatred onto others. Anger and hatred can be intertwined but they also do not have to be. We can feel angry about something and rather than that turning into hatred we show other people, it can turn into other demonstrations. Thats really important because regardless it is difficult to just bottle up anger. We have to turn that anger into something and so it is really powerful to turn it into something other than hatred.
