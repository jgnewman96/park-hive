## Quotes

> This distribution—where one or a few developers do most of the work, followed by a long tail of casual contributors, and many more passive users—is now the norm, not the exception, in open source.

<!-- -->

> Rather than maximizing participation, their work is defined by the opposite: the need to filter and curate a high volume of interactions.

<!-- -->

> But the fact that GitHub became the preferred platform for most developers, overcoming initial opposition that bordered on religious fervor, suggests that maybe platforms do a lot more for creators than we realize.

<!-- -->

> Although the commons might not be as profitable as the firm, it’s also more resilient, because the currency of its transactions is the desire to participate, rather than money.

<!-- -->

> Is software worth nothing, or is it indispensable to society? The answer is both.

<!-- -->

> Much of the fatigue that open source developers experience comes not from making their code public but from expectations around making their code participatory.

<!-- -->

> There will always be a loyal group of followers out there who are excited to support a given opportunity, so long as they have a meaningful relationship to it
