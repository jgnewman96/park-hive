**Where I found  it**: I saw this book mentioned in two places. This [New Yorker piece by Hua Hsu](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/06/the-asian-american-canon-breakers) and in [Trick Mirror](trick_mirror) by Jia Tolentino.

**Why I wanted to read it**: I am interested in reading older books that had a large influence. After seeing this book mentioned in a couple of different places I was interested in reading it for myself. I often find older books that people think are still relevant today to be very powerful reads.

__The Woman Warrior__ is a book of a few stories written by Maxine Hong Kingston. The stories primarily look at Kingston's moms life. The last story is focused on her own life and how she relates to her mother. The book is a fictionalized memoir. It is always difficult to know exactly what that means or how we should interpret it. Literally it means that it tells the story of her life but not all of the elements are actually true. But why did the author decide to make some things up? Is it because they wanted to have a creative license with the story? Is it because Kingston was not present for a lot of parts of her mothers life and so she needed to fill in some gaps?

The stories move in chronological order starting with her Mother's childhood moving to Kingston's own childhood. This structure forces us to be constantly aware of how Kingston came from her mom. That a lot her tendencies and who she is are directly a result of her Mom. We understand Kingston through the background of her parents and what their experiences are.

I am really curious to know what people who read this book when it came out felt about it. The world was so much less connected then. Did this book shape how people viewed China? Who was the intended audience for this novel?

I could imagine another version of this book if it was written today. It would probably be a serious of essays written by Kingston reflecting on her relationship with her mother. It would be much more personal. It would be written in the first person. But this book is not like that at all. We feel much more distant from Kingston. A lot of the stories feel like fiction rather than fact. But this style forces the reader to do more reflection. I have to do the work of connecting the stories about Kingston's mom with her behavior in the present. Kingston does not do that work for the reader. It creates an entirely different reading experience.
