**Why I read it**: I picked up a hard copy of this book on International Workers Day from [East Bay Book Sellers](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/) since the cover had been damaged. I love Bittman's cookbook [How To Cook Everything Vegetarian ](https://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Vegetarian-Meatless/dp/0764524836)



## Quotes

> Calling the beginning of agriculture a "revolution" seems inaccurate. It implies a single moment of invention, and there does appear to have been one. It's better to think of humankind's development of agriculture as evolution.  

<!-- -->

> Soil and the people who work it are the foundation of a thriving society. Wealth has its source in nature, and that wealth must be protected as well as spent
<!-- -->

> Isaac Newton went further: "It should be the aim of every young farmer to ... do his best; to make two blades of grass grow where but one grew before." That statement shows a complete ignorance of nature, the world and even the laws of the universe. Everything if finite, even the riches of land in America. 


<!-- -->

> Thus, a law that aimed to protect the public resulted in a dangerous precedent that reigns to this day. By providing consumers with the name of every ingredient in their processed food and letting them decide what is good and what is not, the government dodges all responsibility under the pretense of "freedom of choice". 

<!-- -->

> The United States wove a wev that would keep former colonies and other developing countries dependent upon them. The imported grain might have helped short-term shortages, but is also discouraged self-sufficient agriculture. 

<!-- -->

> But here's the rub: to a great extent, producers determine what people eat. And while committee and a variety of diverse movements all moved the needle on food, agriculture and environment protection, multinational corporations' counterattack was far more powerful. 

<!-- -->

> Look at a forest or a meadow. You will see thousands of interdependent species. There is balance and stability in these unfettered habitats that allows them to thrive for millennia. Nature likes diversity,  even chaos

<!-- -->

> People talk about "scaling up" but that really isnt the answer; it is more about scaling out, replicating small- and medium-scale sustainable systems in millions of places worldwide.
