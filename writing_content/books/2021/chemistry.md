**Where I found  it**: I saw __Chemistry__ in a book store over a year ago and wrote down the title because I liked the cover. I then saw it recommended by [Delia Cai in her newsletter Deez Links](https://deezlinks.substack.com/) and thought I would read it. 

**Why I wanted to read it**: I struggle to find fiction that I want to read more than I struggle to find non-fiction. My non-fiction list is incredibly long. Seeing a recommendation from someone whose literary taste I respect was more than enough to get me to read this book.

I really enjoyed this novel by Weike Wang. It was difficult to read at times with how real and sad it felt. The novel tells the story of a chemistry PHD student who is struggling with notions of success and with her relationship to her parents. The writing of the novel is broken up into many small chunks. Its very colloquial and very easy to read. 

There are a couple of ideas that this novel really forced me to reflect on. One of them was what it means to be in a relationship with another person and how to be an individual but also part of a unit. It can be really hard to prioritize or even feel like you are prioritizing someone over yourself. Especially in our individualistic society, sacrificing for another person's career or their aspirations can be a really hard thing to do. The main character is scared of following Eric to Ohio and is scared of being unhappy after sacrificing to be with him.

The novel also looks at how we have certain notions of success and how much of our world view can be impacted by our parents and their world view. It can be really difficult that there is a discontinuity between the worlds our parents grew up in and the one we live in now. This can happen just because of age difference but it can be especially difficult if your parents are immigrants. This difficulty was also explored in another book I read recently: [A Place For Us](/#/a_place_for_us). 

Eric, who is the main characters boyfriend is portrayed as exceedingly nice. He is such a supportive boyfriend and is really just so gracious. But one thing that was so difficult to read was how much trouble Eric had understanding the main character. Eric grew up with a very different family dynamic than the main character. This made it hard for him to understand her relationship with her parents and her fears and anxieties. When I first read the book the whole time I was just thinking about how nice Eric is but I now feel like Eric actually did a bad job of trying to understand the main character. Yes, the main character could be more open with him, more vulnerable and share more. But Eric also could have been a better boyfriend in a lot of ways.
