**Why I read it**: I attended a meditation retreat led by Rhonda few years ago right after this book was published.



## Quotes

> Cultivating mindfulness is not and cannot be merely an individual pursuit. Because we can be so blind to our mental processes, biases and racialized identities, we need one another to point out what we cant or wont see. 

<!-- -->

> When we say that race is a _social construction_, we mean that race (like gender) is created and re-created, day to day, through social habits, trainings and conditionings that range from personal performance to institutional policies, and are most often so subtle as to evade our conscious awareness. 

<!-- -->

> And though we had not mentioned it, there was not a moment during our conversation in which we did not know that race was there, between us, running through us. 

<!-- -->

> However, creating space for strong emotion is necessary for developing deeper understanding of how race operates in our lives. Being able to feel all of our feelings, and being able to name them without shame or disapproval, are crucial steps along the path--from seeing what is there, to accepting the reality of it in a way that enables us to acknowledge it more fully. 

<!-- -->

> We have been trained to fear one another. And we all know that when we are afraid, we are simply not our best. Here, we start to see and to feel that we have more in common than not. And to see that we have a lot less to fear from one another than we once believed. 

<!-- -->

> beneath every aggression or effort to attack is a wounded human being. 

<!-- -->

> If racial identity does not seem to define your existence, this may be especially important to reflect on and investigate. We are often defined by racial identity, even if it shows up most in the ways we deny or resist its relevance in our lives.
