**Where I found  it**: I saw this book receive a lot of praise over the summer. My roommate Andrew read the book and he recommended it. After waiting for it from the library for a while I finally got it!

**Why I wanted to read it**: I was mostly inspired to read __The Vanishing Half__ because it received so many positive reviews. Also, the book is about twins and being a twin myself, I was curious how it would talk about that dynamic.


* * *

__The Vanishing Half__ is a story about a family from the fictional town of Mallard, Louisiana starting in the 1960s. The town of Mallard is full of only light skinned Black citizens. The story focuses on two twins from the town, Desiree and Stella. The twins father was killed when they were young by an angry white mob. As the twins are about to turn 18 they run away from home and move to New Orleans. After a year of living in New Orleans Stella leaves Desiree with only a note, and his never seen again.

The story forces us to look at a similar question from many different angles. What does it mean to change who you are? What does it mean that Stella acts like she is white even though she is not? What impact does that have on her and the people around her? We also look at that same question through Reese who goes through a sex transformation. Even with other characters this question of changing who you are is brought into focus. Early talks about how hunting other people involves pretending to be someone else. Kennedy is drawn to acting because it allows her to portray other people. What is considered lying and what is socially acceptable?

The novel does not resolve this question. It is socially acceptable for people to go through a gender transition. But what about changing your race? Or acting like you come from a different place? I imagine that behavior would not be viewed as positively. What does it mean when we want to change certain things about ourselves? Are there certain types of changes we can go through and certain ones that we cannot? How do we balance trying to accept the person that we currently are while also striving to be different in certain ways. These are questions that all of us deal with every day.

Stella and Desiree both experienced the traumatic event of watching their Dad be murdered at a young age. This event impacts both of them for the rest of their lives. Stella will not sleep without a baseball bat by her bed. Stella and Desiree never talk about the impact of that event though. Even though they experienced the event together, it impacted them in slightly different ways. They both made assumptions about how the event impacted the other. This is really the crux of the early part of the novel and the twins growing apart. They assume that they understand what is going on in the other one's head. But we never do know what another person is truly experiencing, even a twin. Desiree assuming how Stella was feeling without actually talking to her is what lead her to be so blindsided by Stella leaving.

Growing up as a twin was really challenging in so many ways. I was consistently trying to understand my own identity in relation to another person. Trying to define who I was, by who I was not. I felt like this novel did not speak to those struggles that I was feeling when I was growing up. This novel did get at how so many people link twins together. They consider twins as one identity rather than understanding them as two individuals.
