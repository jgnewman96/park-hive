The most rewarding experiences in my life are sharing my experience and connecting with others. This website is just one way for me to articulate how I move through the world. My interests are all over the place and constantly changing. I deeply value learning about spaces that are completely novel to me and connecting them to things I have some knowledge about.

Writing and creating, while quite difficult, are some of the most rewarding activities. This one of the big reasons why I love creating software.

A lot of my interests center around understanding human behavior. I am particular fascinated in examining social science questions related to technology.

Here are some pieces to read that give you a sense of how I parse the world

I grew up in an apartment on the Upper West Side of New York. I then moved to Chicago for five years graduating from the University of Chicago and living on the north side for a year. I have been living in Oakland for roughly two years now. I embody the characteristics of both growing up a twin and will forever feel like the younger brother that I am to my six year older brother.

Outside of work I spend a lot of my time playing and training for Ultimate Frisbee. I am an avid cook, mediocre meditator and a so-so journaler.
