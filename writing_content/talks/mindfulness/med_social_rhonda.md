The weekend of February 22 2020, my partner Jenny and I attended a mediation retreat at Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Marin. I wanted to attend a meditation retreat for a while, but never put in the effort to figure out the logistics before. I was looking through different meditation centers around the Bay Area in the fall and landed on Spirit Rock because it practices insight meditation. Insight meditation is the most accessible to me because it less focused on formality or any sort of rigidity.

The retreat we attend was the **The Inner Work of Social Justice: Socially Engaged Mindfulness** led by Rhonda Magee. We were excited because the title suggested the retreat would bring a different perspective and focus to mindfulness then what we had previously been exposed to. The retreat was Saturday and Sunday from 10AM - 4:30PM. The retreat consisted of individual sits, walking meditations, lectures and some interpersonal exercises.

Here are some assorted thoughts from the weekend:

- One feeling that kept coming forward during my sits was fear. On a day to day basis I would not say I have a lot of conscious fear present in my life. I started to notice that fear underlies a lot of my actions and thoughts. During childhood fear is constantly present and can be seen as trivial. We have fear of monsters under the bed, fear of the house catching fire. It does not seem like all that fear goes away, but rather fear may take different forms as we get older. Instead of being scared of a robber entering my house, I have a deeper hidden fear of failing. I have a fear that my actions do not matter or that what I do will not have an impact. This fear can be so hidden that it can be hard to even recognize what it is regularly. I want to embrace that fear rather than run away from it or hide from it. Fear can be such over powering feeling that acknowledging it is difficult. I am excited about doing more work to identify how fear is subtly pushing me in different ways and accepting that fear, rather than trying to deny it.

- I struggle to connect my sits with the rest of my life. Regularly, I will sit down to meditate, focus on my breath for ten minutes and then go back to what I was doing. My headspace while I sit can seem so disconnected from my headspace during the rest of my life. During a sit, my thinking will slow down and I will calm down, but the rest of my time I can still be quite frenzied. This weekend helped me connect my sits better with the rest of my life. Mindfulness is not only about making time to sit. It is also about bringing mindful practices to all my interactions. In meetings if I take a moment to reflect, have a deep breath and then respond that is a way of bringing mindfulness outside of the cushion. Going for a walk in nature and listening to the sounds I hear is another example of bringing mindfulness outside of meditation. This weekend helped me recognize that mindfulness is not solely focused on meditation.

- Meditation can easily be seen as a very personal practice. The process of siting on your own, with your own can be isolating at times. This weekend opened my eyes to meditation being a cross personal experience. I have completed meditations that discussed using mindfulness to connect with others. I always viewed those kind of exercises as doing inner work, so that in other situations I can connect with others. This weekend showed me how mindfulness it self can focus on connecting with others. While that distinction might seem small that slight change in focus can be quite different. My headspace is very different doing inner work to help connect to others rather than directly sitting and focusing on working with others.

- During the weekend we did some group exercises that involved listening to others. We did one exercise that focused on how listening can amplify a voice. When a voice is acutely listened to it is stronger. I want to bring that idea to all parts of my life. By truly listening to someone else and hearing what they are saying, I can amplify what they are trying to convey. During the exercise I also recognized how much I struggle to listen to others. When I am listening I often am already thinking about what I want to say, assuming I know what the person is saying.

- My worldview is often centered on solving problems or finding a solutions. Whenever I am presented with a problem, I want so simplify it and understand it. I avoid holding and accepting radical complexity. Systems are so intricate and dynamic that I will not be able to understand them completely or simplify them. I will not be able to fully understand why certain outcomes occur. While it is always worthwhile to take a stab at understanding and breaking things down, it can also be a good practice to recognize that complexity. Recognize that any simplification inherently does not contain all of that complexity and therefore is an incomplete perspective. One idea that Rhonda proposed is to view all of our answers as provisional answers. We are coming to an answer that works for right now, but it is always subject to change in the future. This kind of perspective goes very well with things I like about a bayesian perspective to uncertainty in statistics.

- During the weekend Rhonda highlighted how much wisdom there is our history. History holds lots of information about how people have joined together through difficult times. There are many instances of people joining together to enact change. We should turn to our ancestors and their practices for insight. While I do not identify as part of any religion, there is a lot of wisdom in how religion provided value to individual's lives. Religion helped give people meaning and build important communities. Rather than turn away from religion because of the bad parts of organized religion, we can recognize the immense value it has provided. We can strive to build new institutions that provide similar communities of support. We can form communities around certain values that support each other. We can use regular practices of meeting to reflect more and bring more consistency to our lives. A world where we all have multiple communities of support connecting with different people could be quite powerful.

- My entire life so far has been working inside the current societal structure. I went through traditional educational institutions. There has not been any decision I made where I deviated from a path that was projected for me. In my head I am working towards some later date where I will have learned enough that I will be able to do important things. I am working within the current societal structure and system to improve it slightly. I am still playing with the idea, that sometimes it is necessary to work outside of the system. That being with in the system inherently limits my worldview and does not allow me to see things outside of the system. If a system systematically hurts certain people, is it enough to just change things on the margins. Do we have to rethink the system all together? Some more thoughts on this to come at a later date.

- Relating to my earlier reflections on fear, I found that at times through out the weekend I felt fake or like an imposter. I felt like what I am doing with regard to social justice is not enough. That I have had so much privilege in my life. I should be spending more of my time volunteering and I should be donating more of my money. While all of this might be true, I want to reflect more on where the feeling of being an imposter comes from. What makes me feel like I belong, versus what makes me feel like I do not. Is there power in recognizing that no matter what I do, there are certain ways I cannot belong to certain things and that is okay. Some more thoughts on this to come at a later date as well.
 
- Rhonda posed the question to us about what a just world look likes. I came up with the following tentative answer:

In a just society everyone is able to fully commit themselves to their curiosity. They are supported and empowered by love from others around them.

- One exercise from the weekend was to form a vow connected to how we think about social justice. I came up with the following vow:
**I vow to embrace fear and discover empowerment for myself and others through communities of support**
