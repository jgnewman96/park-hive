Talk given by Gill Bejerano at stanford 

the human genome 
- a human being is made up of 1o^13 cells 
- a cell is the basic unit of life, helps us understand humans 

- cells come about from just one cell, the fertilized egg 

the gemoe is the operating system that runs every single cell in your body 

start out in one cell, when you make two ceels you replicate the entire genome 

10^13 copies of your genome running that many forks of the same code 

what the biggest challenges in genomics 
- computation is the biggest challenge 
- how does the code work 
- how does the program translate into output 

- we are now able to sequence genomes, a lot cheaper 

sequence a genome during a certain action and see what it is doing during a certain action 

sequency is easier now, but the interpretation is hard

genomic medicine 
- three domains 
    - cancer 
        - is a disease of the genome 
        - by the time we find caner its genome has changed so much 
        - hard to pinpoint which mutations took it down the wrong path to replicate like crazy 
        - this makes it harder to know which genes are driving and which drugs we can use or how to kill the cancer cells 
    - complex disease ` 
        - we dont know how many genes are involved in the diseases 
        - new risk scores polygenic without even understanding 
    - simple disease 
        - disease that happens when you break a single gene 
        - it is still quite a task to diagnose this disease 
        - this is where the most progress in genomic medicine has been made 
        - we can now diagnoese 6,000 simple disease to mutations in 4,000 diseases 
            - can break a gene in different ways to get a different disease, too much of a gene or too little of a gene 

find the cause of the disease through the gene and then bring the cure to the person 

ideally we could sequence every person at birth and then we could diagnose and treat everyone 

every newporn is now measure by the apgar scoring system, so why not sequence everyone's genes at both

what does it mean to diagnose a patient 

three components 
    - what is there medical record? previous history or symptomps 
        -healthcare is the number 1 business in the US 
    - genomic readings 
    - biomedical knowledge 
all of these go together to diagnose a person 

we want to find patient varient that explains patient pheno type 

patient diagnosis is quite hard 
- medical record is a mess 
- biomedical knowledge is all over the place and different doctors have different info 
- get genomic reads is still has error 

drowning in a see of data where they have quite poor software 

we do not want clinician to be in front of open ended search engine 
- we want to bring all the data to them 
- have the computer take the first guessing 
- how can we combine humans with data and ML to make diagnosis better using the genome 

## my thoughts 

good to learn about another field 
- medicial diagnoses is so so so hard 
- we need to find better ways to use AI to help and augment and have people work together
