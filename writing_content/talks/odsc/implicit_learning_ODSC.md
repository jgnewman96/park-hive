Talk given by [Laurent El Ghaoui](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~elghaoui/) : Professor at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) and chief scientist at [Sumup Analytics](https://www.sumup.ai/)

This talk was about a new area of Deep Learning research that is still very much theory. In this approach rather than specifying the architecture of a given model, the data tells us the structure of our model. This approach provides for new notation and new conceptual ways for us to think about deep learning. This approach is notationally much simpler and having this abstraction in notation allows us to do a lot of more powerful things.

## my thoughts

I Struggled to really understand what was going on in this talk. I also left a little bit early to attend another talk. I find it really difficult to wrap my head around theory if it is not motivated really well and given examples. Otherwise I need to work through the theory on my own. Concrete examples are just so helpful to ground what you are talking about.
